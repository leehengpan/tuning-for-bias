Bill Cassidy, R-La., is the top Republican on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee that will consider the nomination of Julie Su, who became acting Labor Secretary after Marty Walsh stepped down in mid-March to lead the national hockey players\u2019 union. Cassidy told Fox News Digital that based on her performance as secretary of the California Labor and Workforce Development Agency, and as deputy Labor secretary, Su is wrong for gig economy workers.\n\nCassidy said that during her tenure as California\u2019s labor chief, Su supported a regulatory proposal known as AB5, which was aimed at tightening restrictions on who employers could classify as an independent contractor. He said Su would pursue] similar goals in Washington.\n\n\"Julie Su has overseen the development of anti-worker regulations at Labor that would destroy the gig economy, striping 21 million individuals of their ability to be independent contractors and enjoy the flexibility it provides,\" Cassidy told Fox News Digital.\n\nBIDEN LABOR SECRETARY NOMINEE OVERSAW BILLIONS OF DOLLARS LOST IN UNEMPLOYMENT FRAUD AS NEWSOM CABINET MEMBER\n\nSu also supported what became known as the \"joint employer rule\" in California, which was designed to extend a franchisee operator's liability to the franchisor. Opponents of the provision argue that it would make it more difficult to create and sustain franchise businesses because it would unfairly make the parent company liable for incidents at the franchisee level, and in the end, make it more difficult to employ people in these companies.\n\n\"She has made public comments about her intention to impose the joint employer rule on franchises nationwide. This would uproot the franchise model which employs over 8 million Americans,\" the senator said.\n\nCassidy\u2019s comments are an early signal of the direction Senate Republicans will take as they consider Su, just weeks after they managed to derail two of the president\u2019s high profile nominations in just one month with the help of moderates in the Democratic caucus.\n\nCONSERVATIVES REJOICE AFTER KEY BIDEN NOMINEE WITHDRAWS: 'ENORMOUS VICTORY FOR FREE SPEECH'\n\nPhillip Washington, Biden's nominee to lead the Federal Aviation Administration, bowed out shortly after Gigi Sohn gave up the fight to serve on the Federal Communications Commission.\n\nThe two issues highlighted by Cassidy have the potential to again sap support from moderate Democrats in the Senate. As the Senate left for the Easter break, it wasn't clear where moderate Democrats up for re-election in 2024 think about Su, such as Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., Jon Tester, D-Mt., and Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz.\n\nSENATE REJECTION OF BIDEN\u2019S CONTROVERSIAL NOMINEES REVEALS \u2018OUT OF TOUCH\u2019 PRESIDENT, GOP SAYS\n\nWhile those senators approved Su's nomination to be deputy secretary of Labor, those positions could shift. Manchin\u2019s office told Fox News Digital that he \"hasn\u2019t made a decision\" on Su\u2019s nomination yet.\n\nCLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOne Republican member of the Senate HELP Committee said that once again, the fate of this Biden nominee will depend on whether Senate Democrats stick together.\n\n\"I don't know that there's a Republican for her,\" Sen.

The effort, led by Montana, Utah and Louisiana, comes ahead of proxy season during which most companies hold annual shareholder meetings where they vote on key policy initiatives.\n\n\"This ESG nonsense is filtering into a lot of our states and the way they're doing it is really, really concerning and probably flagrantly illegal,\" Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen told Fox News Digital in an interview. \"Pushing it through these asset managers and through these proxy votes is extremely concerning.\"\n\n\"The message is: 'Stay in your lane and do what you're supposed to do.

The two associations require members to make certain climate commitments.\n\nLOUISIANA DIVESTS FROM BLACKROCK OVER ESG POLICIES: 'WOULD DESTROY LOUISIANA\u2019S ECONOMY'\n\nFor example, the NZAM requires members to \"accelerate the transition towards global net zero emissions and for asset managers to play our part to help deliver the goals of the Paris Agreement.\" NZAM members also commit to implement \"a stewardship and engagement strategy, with a clear escalation and voting policy, that is consistent with [their] ambition for all assets under management to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 or sooner.\"\n\nAnd the Climate Action 100+ initiative seeks commitments from boards and senior management to \"reduce greenhouse gas emissions across the value chain\" via net zero commitments.\n\n\"None of this is financially defensible,\" the attorneys general stated in their letter. \"Instead, it is a transparent attempt to push policies through the financial system that cannot be achieved at the ballot box.\"\n\nKnudsen added that he was concerned ESG policies would ultimately harm Montana residents by reducing their energy options and hiking prices.\n\n\"Montana's a northern state.

In 2021, the firm's CEO Larry Fink said that pension funds, foundations and endowments \"should have a loud voice with [fossil fuel] companies to move forward.\"\n\nThe letter Thursday also warned against taking certain actions promoting race and gender quotas or abortion. More than 20 abortion-related proxy measures have been proposed this year, more than every other year combined, according to the shareholder advocacy group As You Sow.\n\nIn addition to BlackRock, the letter was sent to Franklin Templeton, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, Invesco, JP Morgan, State Street and dozens of other asset managers."}, {"title": "DC racial equity plan may land nation's capital as defendant in courtroom: expert", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dc-racial-equity-plan-may-land-nations-capital-defendant-courtroom-expert", "tag": "WASHINGTON DC", "content": "Washington, D.C. may soon find itself as a defendant in a courtroom if it pushes ahead with a racial equity plan that, critics argue, is unconstitutional.\n\nD.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, established an advisory committee called the Black Homeownership Strike Force in June 2022 to \"combat the racial wealth gap\" by making recommendations to increase and support homeownership for Black residents of the nation's capital.\n\nBowser tasked the group with developing a plan to produce 20,000 new Black homeowners by 2030. That led to a report released by the Strike Force in October outlining a series of recommendations, which the mayor's office reviewed to determine their cost and legality.\n\nThe recommendations included giving homeownership units to Black homebuyers, providing financial support for Black homeowners who want to rehabilitate their homes, and creating a program to support Black homeowners unable to pay their mortgages, among other measures.\n\nREPUBLICANS MOVE TO DISMANTLE DC\u2019S POLICE REFORM BILL\n\nLast week, Bowser presented her budget proposal for the next fiscal year and included $8 million to support the Strike Force's recommendations, as well as $10 million for a \"Black Homeownership Fund\" to sell homes to Black owner-occupant homebuyers.\n\nNow it's up to the D.C.

Under a previous rule put into place by President Donald Trump, plan managers were required to prioritize financial returns for workers.\n\nBy changing rules governing investment managers, Biden is hoping to redirect the massive amount of wealth American workers have amassed in their private retirement accounts. In June 2021, the total value of all U.S. 401(k) accounts was $7.3 trillion.\n\nAlthough some ESG factors promote causes all Americans agree on, such as ending child labor, many are designed to promote left-wing ideological views. For example, some of the most influential ESG ratings systems measure companies based on the ratio of various racial groups in their workforce, as well as their commitment to battling climate change and providing funding for social justice initiatives.\n\nWHAT ESG INVESTING IS, AND WHY SOME POLITICIANS ARE AGAINST IT\n\nThe legislative attempt to block the rule from going into effect included support from Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin, of West Virginia, and Jon Tester, of Montana.\n\nNow that Biden\u2019s plan is sure to go into effect, employers and investment plan managers will have the ability to consider ESG factors when choosing plan options for workers. That means if you have a private-sector retirement plan, such as a 401(k), your hard-earned retirement savings could soon be used to advance ideas with which you do not agree.\n\nPerhaps even more importantly, depending on which ESG options your employer chooses, your retirement account could also soon take a financial hit because of Biden\u2019s rule. As one writer for the Harvard Business Review reported in 2022, academic researchers have found \"ESG funds certainly perform poorly in financial terms.\"\n\nWhat can you do to ensure that your retirement savings are protected from Biden\u2019s far-reaching ESG rule? The following five steps are a good place to start.\n\n1. Talk to your plan manager and employer\n\nThe first step working Americans with a 401(k) or similar retirement plan should take is to talk with their employer\u2019s human resources representative and retirement plan manager to find out if they are considering imposing ESG options in the future. If they are, demand that they continue to offer non-ESG options as well.\n\nHONEY, BIDEN JUST SHRUNK OUR PENSION\n\nThe Biden rule does not require plan managers to offer ESG; it only makes it possible. By putting pressure on employers and plan managers, you and other employees could stop Biden\u2019s plan in its tracks.\n\n2. Switch from the 'default' option\n\nMany employees enrolled in an employer-sponsored retirement account can choose from a list of investment options, but those who elect not to choose their own option allow their investment managers to make choices for them.\n\nUnder the Biden rule, employers and investment managers now have the ability to make the default option an ESG investment. That means if you don\u2019t take charge of your retirement, you could end up promoting ESG causes and getting lower returns, even though you might not have to.\n\n3. Pay close attention to investment fees\n\nInvesting in retirement funds usually requires a fee. Although investment fees have been falling for more than two decades, ESG funds often charge significantly higher fees than other kinds of funds. In some cases, fees associated with ESG funds are five times higher than non-ESG funds.\n\nRegardless of whether you choose to invest in an ESG fund or not, pay special attention to the fees associated with the various options, and demand that plan managers offer as many low-fee alternatives as possible.\n\n4. Hire a private investment adviser\n\nInvestment managers hired by your employer work for your employer. Although they are supposed to make decisions in your best financial interests, Biden\u2019s rule allows them to focus on ESG causes too.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nIf your employer and investment manager decide to go all-in on ESG, consider hiring an investment adviser of your own. Investment advisers are not nearly as unaffordable as many people might think, and they are legally and ethically obligated to provide you with the advice you ask for. So, if you want to find the best ways to avoid ESG in your retirement, they can help, and they might even be able to get you a better return on your investment than your employer\u2019s management firm.\n\n5. Consider a Roth IRA instead\n\nSimilar to 401(k) plans, Roth individual retirement accounts (IRAs) provide significant tax benefits, although they work differently than 401(k) plans.\n\nInstead of making contributions tax-free and then paying taxes on withdrawals later in life \u2013 the way a traditional 401(k) works \u2013 workers contribute funds to a Roth IRA account after they have paid taxes on the money. That means contributions to a Roth IRA grow tax-free.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nRoth IRAs provide more options for those seeking alternatives to 401(k) accounts, and often provide much more flexibility and freedom for workers, allowing Americans to avoid ESG investments.\n\nRoth IRA accounts do have limitations, and certain higher-income earners are not eligible to use them, so workers interested in these investment vehicles should speak with an investment advisor before making contributions."}, {"title": "On this day in history, March 30, 1858, American visionary Hymen Lipman patents pencil with eraser", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/this-day-history-march-30-1858-american-visionary-hymen-lipman-patents-pencil-eraser", "tag": "LIFESTYLE", "content": "Philadelphia inventor Hymen L.

And 61% are \"extremely\" concerned about inflation, which is at least 15 points higher than any other issue.\n\n\u2014 More than seven in 10 say inflation has caused their family hardship, and many couldn\u2019t make ends meet if they missed more than two paychecks.\n\nAbout three-quarters say inflation has caused them hardship over the last six months, including 32% who describe it as a serious hardship. Those sentiments have held steady over the last few months.\n\nOver half, 54%, couldn\u2019t miss more than two paychecks before falling behind on their bills. That\u2019s identical to the 54% who said the same under the Trump administration in 2019. In fact, four years ago, 20% couldn\u2019t afford to miss even one paycheck, and that\u2019s improved a touch to 17% now.\n\nSome 68% of those living in households earning less than $50,000 annually could only miss two paychecks before having trouble paying bills.

At the same time, it\u2019s worse than at the end of the Trump administration, when 66% said the same. Today, 23% rate conditions positively, down from 33% in December 2020.\n\n\u2014 Views are divided over the government\u2019s response to recent bank failures, and most dislike how President Biden is handling the economy, including a sizable number of Democrats.\n\nThe president\u2019s job rating on the economy is upside-down by 29 points: 35% of voters approve, 64% disapprove \u2014 with 35% of Democrats and 68% of independents giving a thumbs-down.\n\nOverall, more disapprove (48%) than approve (44%) of the government bailing out Silicon Valley and Signature banks after their March 10 collapse, although that\u2019s largely driven by partisanship. Two-thirds of Democrats approve, while two-thirds of Republicans disapprove.\n\n\u2014 Nearly seven in 10 are concerned about the U.S. banking system, but far more than that feel confident in their own bank.\n\nEven after this month\u2019s failures, nearly nine in 10 feel confident in the stability of their bank.

Nearly one in five feels safest with their money under the mattress (18%). That means that while more pick the bank than any other individual alternative, a majority goes with a non-bank option (gold, market, crypto, or mattress).\n\nSixty-nine percent of voters worry about the U.S. banking system. That\u2019s on par with concern over their tax bill and book banning (71% each), as well as border security, gun laws, what\u2019s taught in schools (69% each) and possible war with China (68%) or Russia (66%).\n\nBiden ratings\n\nBiden\u2019s overall job rating has mostly held steady for over a year and currently stands at 44% approve vs. 56% disapprove.

Both individuals and businesses tend to leave high-tax jurisdictions. The rate of relocations seems to directly correlate with tax rates and the impact of costly infrastructures.

The area is home to about 88% of the nation's cobalt reserves in addition to a large amount of copper, nickel and platinum-group elements.\n\nAnd a DOI subagency announced earlier this month that it would consider a separate 20-year mining ban across 20,574 acres near Rapid City, South Dakota, that contains lithium, gold, copper and silver deposits.

Our oldest are 15 and 11, and we\u2019re constantly trying to impress upon them the value of a dollar earned, how to budget and give generously, and the difference between needs and wants. Those lessons are easier to pick up in that all-important first job during high school.\n\nOur leaders in Arkansas want to help. On March 8, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed a law repealing our youth-permitting system. Before, teenagers younger than 16 had to ask state authorities for permission to get a summer or weekend job. The process required filling out a form, getting signatures from parents and businesses, mailing it to the Department of Labor and Licensing, and waiting for approval from Little Rock. Now that barrier is broken, even as Arkansas still limits how many hours teenagers can work and federal child labor laws are still in effect.\n\nBut that\u2019s not how the mainstream media and coastal liberals characterize it. Out-of-state elites have savaged Arkansas for empowering teenagers to work part-time.\n\n\"Arkansas Gov. Sanders signs law loosening child labor protections,\" blared the Washington Post, while MSNBC declared that Republicans want to \"make child labor great again.\" California Gov. Gavin Newsom jumped in, tweeting \"gotta admit, loosening child labor laws was not on my top 10 list for our CA legislative session this year.\"\n\nGOV. SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS TAKES ON CRITICS OF EDUCATION REFORM PLAN: OUR KIDS ARE IN A \u2018BROKEN SYSTEM\u2019\n\nGov. Sanders stands accused of doing the bidding of big business, putting profits ahead of children\u2019s education and development. Worse, prominent influencers are circulating misleading pictures of her signing a bill next to pre-teen children, falsely alleging that it\u2019s this reform. Others are linking the policy to stories about illegally employed young kids \u2013 hired in violation of the state\u2019s requirements \u2013 or deceitfully accusing Gov. Sanders of wanting to get minority children working in meat-packing plants. With states like Iowa considering reforms of their own, it\u2019s a safe bet that liberals will spend the next two years falsely painting Republicans as a danger to children\u2019s well-being, if not their survival.\n\nThese partisan attacks have no resemblance to reality. We\u2019re not talking about sending junior to work the graveyard shift at the factory Sunday through Saturday. We\u2019re talking about bussing tables a couple nights a week after school, working the check-out counter on weekends, and staying busy during summer. Besides, the main push for this reform didn\u2019t come from big business. It came from families like mine, who want more of the freedom that lets our children flourish. We are not a state that values perpetual adolescence and government control. We are a state that thinks families know best and work leads to better lives.\n\nSARAH SANDERS' SLAM DUNK. CHOICE NOW IS BETWEEN \u2018NORMAL OR CRAZY\u2019 AND PARENTS MUST STAND UP\n\nIt harms teenagers when you discourage them from learning through work. Teens who work as little as one year will, in their 20s, have incomes that are 14-16% higher on average. Teenage work also leads to less property crime and drug use and higher graduation rates. Keeping a schedule, collaborating with others, discovering your skills and your shortcomings \u2013 these lessons complement what you learn in the classroom. When it comes to preparing teenagers for adulthood, the informal training of work strengthens formal education.\n\nBesides, who\u2019s really holding back teenagers? About two-thirds of the country has youth-permitting regimes that give state bureaucrats or schools control over teenagers\u2019 ability to get jobs. That includes Newsom\u2019s California, where schools have final say in issuing work permits. In 2021, barely a quarter of 16- to 19-year-old Californians worked, nearly 10 percentage points lower than the national average. Why isn\u2019t Newsom attacking his neighbors in Oregon, which doesn\u2019t require youth permits either?\n\nNationwide, only 36% of teenagers between the ages of 16 and 19 participated in the labor force at the end of 2021, down from almost 60% in the 1970s. Can anyone honestly say that American teenagers are more responsible and well-rounded now than they were 50 years ago? Does anyone really believe most teenagers are better prepared for the rigors of adult life?\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nStates should be doing everything they can to prepare teens for lives of meaning and contribution, including through that first weekend or summer job. It\u2019s no coincidence that the two states with the highest teenage labor force participation rates \u2013 Kansas and Utah \u2013 don\u2019t require youth work permits.

Citing \"solidarity\" and a need for raises and \"respect,\" they\u2019re walking off the job, and once again pulling the rug out from under vulnerable children who are already suffering immensely from loss of learning and extreme emotional trauma, all thanks to UTLA.\n\nUTLA is also dealing another blow to the great teachers and school employees dedicated to providing children an excellent and uninterrupted education. You likely don\u2019t know these good folks exist since UTLA and most media drown out their voices, but there are hundreds of LAUSD employees of integrity who get bullied by UTLA for putting the children first.\n\nThe union just can\u2019t help itself. Using children and teachers as pawns in a political game that pits students against adult entitlements, gives unions and their political allies great power. That\u2019s why they silence the voices of educators who are awake to their corruption, and use manipulated and unsuspecting teachers as poster children for the union agenda.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times printed an op-ed written by a UTLA poster teacher whose piece was full of union talking points. She shared she was striking in part because teachers need respect. It seems lost on her that abandoning the children she was hired to serve is not a respectable thing to do \u2013 for any reason. And that to receive respect, one must be respectable.\n\nMORE THAN 500,000 STUDENTS HOME FROM SCHOOL ON FIRST DAY OF LOS ANGELES UNION STRIKE\n\nPerhaps she\u2019s unaware that at the last UTLA strike, union activists were caught on camera physically blocking a family as they tried to drive into the school.

That\u2019s not behavior worthy of respect.\n\n\n\nMaybe she doesn\u2019t know that UTLA had backroom deals with the CDC to keep schools closed while denying children the right to learn. Or that UTLA abandoned teachers opposed to COVID vaccine mandates and still refuses to support the more than 1,000 LAUSD employees who\u2019ve been forced from their jobs for choosing to make their own medical decisions.\n\nUTLA is so void of respectable behavior that dozens of LAUSD teachers told me, \"We believe in doing the exact opposite of whatever UTLA tells us to do as they have been found untrustworthy. We\u2019ve awakened to the ways they are the source of the perils in our schools.\"\n\nSo UTLA may want respect, but it has earned our contempt. We loathe UTLA because it has placed its own selfish desires above the needs and rights of children, good teachers, parents, and taxpayers.\n\nTragically, union behavior paints all teachers (even the great ones) with the broad brush of contempt. But most teachers are nothing like the unions that claim to represent them.\n\nDozens of good teachers witnessed a UTLA rally on March 15. They told me, \"UTLA paraded posters of our superintendent dressed as a donkey and wished death upon him. They said to avoid a strike, LAUSD must agree to a list of demands \u2013 many of which have nothing to do with education. This is not a union that speaks for the teachers and students of LAUSD.\"\n\nBut you won\u2019t see the testimonies of these dedicated teachers in the LA Times or most media outlets. And that\u2019s a tragedy because the radical political agenda of the union is so disturbing that many of these teachers \u2013 at great personal cost \u2013 will cross the picket line during the strike. These are the people we can respect \u2013 true servants, putting themselves in harm\u2019s way in defense of children and decency.\n\nSo, how about we stop giving air to disrespectful union strikes, and instead listen to the teachers who have the respect and courage to cross the picket line?\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThey\u2019ll have newsworthy stories of union mafia tactics used against them as they stand in defense of our children.

First, you have to make changes so that the crisis never happens again, and then you have to hold anyone that failed to do the right thing fully accountable. This isn\u2019t easy, but it\u2019s necessary if you want to truly reform anything and make it better.\n\nFollowing the last two years of failed policy from the Federal Reserve, and this month\u2019s shocking failures of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank, it\u2019s clear we need big change now at the Fed. That\u2019s why I\u2019m introducing legislation to make needed changes at our central bank and hold bad actors at the banks accountable. I will fight like hell to protect American families and workers so the only winners here aren\u2019t woke big tech billionaires and Wall Street.\n\nI was a bit shocked when President Biden and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen repeatedly claimed last week that the U.S. banking system is strong. Excuse me for not jumping to believe the economic opinions of the people who told us inflation was \"only temporary\" in 2021. The people I talk to in Florida feel the same way. You can't trust anything out of the federal government right now, it's all massaged to fit their narrative.\n\nThe Biden administration lied about inflation, COVID origins, Afghanistan and countless other crises. That\u2019s why we need independent authorities who can investigate government and fight for the transparency and accountability our citizens deserve. Across most of the government, we have these officials in the form of inspectors general. These presidentially appointed, Senate-confirmed investigators have the authority to get answers and expose fraud, waste, abuse and corruption. What\u2019s shocking is that the Federal Reserve doesn\u2019t have this oversight.\n\nECONOMY IS IN THE TANK, BANKS ARE REELING, INFLATION IS SKY-HIGH AND THERE'S MORE BIDEN ISN'T TELLING YOU\n\nYes, you read that right. The Federal Reserve, the world\u2019s largest and most powerful central bank, does not have a truly independent IG to investigate it. I\u2019m fighting to fix that and will be introducing a bill soon \u2013 that I believe will have bipartisan support \u2013 to establish a presidentially-appointed, Senate-confirmed inspector general at the Fed like every other major government agency. This is commonsense and something that should have been done a long time ago.\n\nIf Fed Chairman Jerome Powell really cares about the American economy and serving the taxpayers, he will do three things during the Fed\u2019s meeting this week: put his support behind this idea, tell us who at the Fed is being fired for its lack of bank oversight, and tell us what changes have been made so this never happens again. Let\u2019s see if he\u2019s brave enough to do it.\n\nWe cannot repeat 2008, where the Federal Reserve fails to do its job, no one at the Fed is held accountable, no changes are made there, and the rich and Wall Street get richer while working families struggle.\n\nOf course, forcing more accountability at the Fed is only one piece of fixing this disaster. Banks need to be held accountable too.\n\nThe fact that executives at Silicon Valley Bank handed out bonuses, and paid themselves, when they knew they were going under is disgusting and shouldn\u2019t be allowed. Along with my bill to install an independent IG at the Fed, I\u2019ll be fighting to pass legislation that claws back these bonuses and any other excess compensation. We have to make sure that money is paid back to cover their losses and make innocent customers whole.\n\nRight now, the system is set up to benefit the old Washington-Wall Street insiders while the American people are on the hook. We saw it in 2008 when the banks got a bailout and you paid for it. Now it\u2019s happening again.\n\nThey might claim that the banks are going to pay for it with higher fees, but that\u2019s just a pass through to bank customers. No one believes that.

But that doesn\u2019t mean we should just sit and wait. We have to keep bringing this fight up every day because that\u2019s the only way things will ever change. Installing a truly independent IG at the Fed is a great start and we should do it RIGHT NOW.\n\nSo, it\u2019s time for some tough questions to get answered. We clearly need accountability from each of the failed banks. We don't need to bail out bad actors who mismanaged money, devoted themselves to woke nonsense instead of fiscal accountability and even gave themselves bonuses as the ship was sinking.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Fed needs to tell us what they knew about these bank\u2019s vulnerabilities, when they knew it, who is at fault and what changes they are making.

Witnesses from various sectors voiced concerns over several interest areas, including U.S. military readiness, land ownership and manufacturing.\n\nThese issues aren\u2019t always top-of-mind for most Americans, but they have great impacts on everyday life in my home state of Michigan and across the country. There is no piece of American life that the Chinese government hasn\u2019t thought to meddle in, and it\u2019s far past time Congress addresses this growing threat head-on.\n\nWhen faced with rising tensions, war is never the first option. Deterrence is the best path forward until it becomes necessary to initiate military action. Former Deputy National Security Advisor Matthew Pottinger expressed in his written testimony to the select committee that our nation must \"constrain and temper\" China \"through robust, coordinated military deterrence (including an urgent expansion of our defense industrial capacity).\"\n\nCHINA\u2019S PRESIDENT TO VISIT RUSSIA IN APPARENT SHOW OF SUPPORT FOR PUTIN\n\nThe U.S. is currently engaged in deterrence on several fronts, including our ongoing support for Ukraine in its war against Russia, as well as increasing support for Taiwan as tensions escalate between the island and China. However, the U.S. strategy must also include investments in our own military readiness in case the fight comes toward our shores.\n\nCongress has begun hearings with military leadership on programs to prioritize in the Fiscal Year 2024 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). As a member on the House Armed Services Committee, I\u2019ll be scrutinizing current budgets and programs that will bolster our military\u2019s readiness levels while being conscientious of taxpayer dollars.\n\nWhile many programs contribute to deterrence and readiness goals, there are three that will be influential not only for the United States, but also for our allies. Reports have indicated China\u2019s growing submarine fleet and its increasing capabilities, creating an urgency for anti-submarine capabilities. The Navy\u2019s P-8A Poseidon will play a critical role in combating this specific fleet as the only naval aircraft that can detect and track foreign submarines.\n\nThe RGM-84 Harpoon Missile program will also play a decisive role in U.S. readiness and any active theaters of war that occur. It is capable of both land-strike and anti-ship missions and supports U.S. military missions as well as those of more than 30 partner nations around the world. This advances deterrence while providing essential readiness capabilities to U.S. allies.\n\nHowever, deterrence is about more than weapons and military equipment. It\u2019s also about protecting our assets inside our borders. The Chinese government and some of its deep-pocketed loyalists have been quietly buying up American farmland. This poses a major threat to our national security.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture released data noting that more than 380,000 acres of U.S. farmland are controlled by Chinese landowners. While China isn\u2019t the primary purchaser of U.S. farmland, it is the most worrisome.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nReports show that Chinese ownership of U.S. farmland increased \"more than 20-fold in a decade from $81 million in 2010 to nearly $1.9 billion\" in 2021. More concerning is that hundreds of acres purchased by Chinese-backed investors are mere miles from U.S. military installations, including the Grand Forks Air Base in North Dakota and Laughlin Air Force Base in Texas.\n\nSeveral pieces of legislation are currently under consideration in the House to monitor existing sales of U.S. farmland and deter future sales to parties with ties to the Chinese government. Two important bills are H.R. 7892 and H.R. 5490, both of which I support. To ensure our safety, increase national defense, and prohibit further infiltration by the Chinese government, there must be measures put in place to protect our assets.\n\nDeterrence also means decreasing America\u2019s reliance on Chinese manufacturing and investing more in American-made production.

Bottom line: there were none.\n\nIn other words, there were plenty of regulations and processes in place to prevent the catastrophe that occurred at SVB. Critics have assailed the San Francisco Fed, the supervisory authority, and its chief Mary Daly, for negligence.

In a shameless bid to buy votes, Biden and the Democrat majority in Congress spent trillions of unneeded dollars, mainly aimed at politically favored groups like the teachers\u2019 unions and the climate lobby, driving the economy into warp speed and igniting inflation.\n\nJay Powell, hoping to be reappointed Fed Chair, ignored rising prices for months, continuing to buy hundreds of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of bonds and mortgage-backed securities even as inflation topped 6%, aware that his only competition for the job was Lael Brainard, an avowed \"dove.\" Moving faster to tackle inflation might have cost Powell his job.\n\nSILICON VALLEY BANK HAD MORE RED FLAGS THAN A CCP MEETING BUT REGULATORS CARED ABOUT CLIMATE NOT BANK RISKS\n\nMeanwhile, Treasury Secretary Yellen became a cheerleader for blowing up the country\u2019s deficits, all the while dismissing inflation as \"small\" and \"manageable\"; it wasn\u2019t until the end of 2021 that she admitted it was not, after all, \"transitory\". Once a respected economist, Yellen has become a political hack.\n\nJoe Biden and Janet Yellen lie when they say the economy was \"reeling\" when he became president; it was actually growing at 6% and recovering nicely from the once-in-a-lifetime shutdown caused by COVID-19. Thanks to bipartisan efforts to prop up stalled businesses and consumers who had lost their jobs, the slump occasioned by the coronavirus pandemic was sharp but mercifully short-lived.

In the last few months, Chicago squatters have taken over the homes of two residents in the same neighborhood after the elderly homeowners died and left the homes to family members.\n\nDarthula Young said this week that her deceased mother\u2019s property in the Chatham neighborhood of Chicago was taken over by a man she described as a \"professional squatter\" with a long criminal record who changed the locks and has racked up a $1,300 water bill that she is on the hook for.\n\nCHICAGO HOMEOWNER TELLS 'FOX & FRIENDS' SHE CAN'T REMOVE SQUATTER FROM HER HOUSE: 'REALLY INFURIATING'\n\nKaren Polk also lost her mother recently and realized while she was prepping the property to sell that a family had moved in , claiming that they had signed a lease and paid rent up front to another person that Polk did not know.\n\nBoth Young and Polk first discovered the squatters in September and both of them are still tied up in the court process, which can take six months or longer \u2013 and that\u2019s only if the alleged squatters show up to court.\n\nIn both cases, the hands of the police were reportedly tied since they are unable to definitively determine who is telling the truth and whose paperwork is legitimate, which is a job for the court system.\n\n\"If somebody is living in a home and saying 'hey, I signed a lease, I'm paying rent, I have a right to be here,' whether or not that\u2019s true the police hear that story then they hear a story of somebody who's not living there and saying 'this is my place these people don't belong here,' the police officer can't make that legal determination,\" Burling said.\n\nMARYLAND HOMEBUYERS 'DISTRAUGHT' AFTER FINDING STRANGERS LIVING IN NEW HOUSE AND REFUSING TO LEAVE\n\n\"It's not their job.

Jared Golden blasted the Biden administration for targeting his state's lobster industry with eco regulations while ignoring the environmental impacts of offshore wind projects.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News Digital, Golden said the federal government has held Maine lobstermen to an unfair standard over their impacts on the endangered North Atlantic right whale species compared to how it has treated offshore wind developers and other ocean-based industries. He added the administration's actions were aimed at appeasing environmental groups that have similarly targeted lobstermen.\n\n\"The hypocrisy part is what pisses me off because we know that right whales, other whales, get struck by freight vessels all the time. Cruise ships that are out there carting people around hit them,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"You see very little effort by the federal government to do anything.\"\n\n\"And yet they see a small business lobster fishery up in Maine that's not politically important to them and they try to crush it just to try to prove to the environmental groups that they're actively trying to protect the right whales,\" he continued.\n\nDOZENS OF NJ MAYORS CALL FOR IMMEDIATE OFFSHORE WIND MORATORIUM AFTER LATEST WHALE DEATHS\n\nIn recent years, federal agencies have attempted to crack down on Maine's lobster fishery despite scant evidence of whale impacts. Lobster industry groups, though, have pointed to federal data which shows that there has never been a recorded right whale death caused by lobster fishing equipment in Maine and the last recorded whale entanglement in fishing gear came more than two decades ago.\n\nIndustry groups and lawmakers including Golden have also said the rules, which the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) first rolled out in May 2022 with more set for 2024 and 2030, would threaten thousands of blue-collar jobs. Maine's lobster industry \u2014 which by state law is made up entirely of small business operators \u2014 provides the U.S. with about 90% of the nation's lobster supply, making the industry a top economic driver in the state, and boosting other related industries as well.\n\nAt the same time, the government in recent months has repeatedly defended offshore wind projects in the face of an unprecedented uptick in whale deaths and widespread calls for a moratorium on offshore wind development until the deaths are further studied. More than 20 whale deaths have been recorded along the East Coast since December with most coming in New Jersey, New York and Virginia where large wind projects are under development.\n\nNJ CONGRESSMAN AIMS TO FORCE BIDEN ADMIN TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER WIND PROJECTS ARE KILLING WHALES\n\n\"Am I concerned about hypocrisy in how the federal government deals with like the Maine lobster fishery, as opposed to big energy projects?\" Golden continued. \"The answer is 100% yes, because for four years now, I have been constantly harassing the federal government to show us one piece of evidence that Maine's lobster fishery is at all responsible for any kind of entanglement of whales let alone a death of a right whale.\"\n\n\"They can't show any field-gathered data,\" he said. \"All they have are these computer-driven formulas that show risk even though it's been almost 20 years since there was a whale entanglement associated with the Maine lobster fishery. Despite the complete lack of any data they've tried to regulate that fishery nearly out of business.\"\n\nLast week, Golden joined Reps. Jeff Van Drew, R-N.J., Chris Smith, R-N.J., and Andy Harris, R-Md., in writing a letter to federal officials demanding more information about the risks offshore wind projects pose to marine wildlife. They noted that wind leases occupy more than 1.7 million acres of waters along the Atlantic coastline, a vast area that will become a large wind turbine construction zone over the next decade.\n\nThe letter also highlighted a 2022 internal memo from Sean Hayes, NOAA's chief of protected species, who stated that \"oceanographic impacts from installed and operating turbines cannot be mitigated\" and would particularly impact the dwindling right whale population.\n\nGREEN GROUPS TARGETING BLUE-COLLAR LOBSTERMEN ARE LARGELY FUNDED BY DARK MONEY\n\n\"Offshore wind development and deployment stands to be a consequential national undertaking, which is why our approach should be done correctly the first time, with full consideration taken in order to mitigate negative impacts on marine species such as the North Atlantic right whale,\" the letter concluded.\n\nIn addition, Golden directed his ire at environmental groups that have maintained attacks on Maine's lobster industry. Last year, California-based Monterey Bay Aquarium \u2014 which has commitments from companies like Blue Apron, Cheesecake Factory, Hello Fresh and Whole Foods \u2014 downgraded Maine lobster from \"good alternative\" to \"avoid,\" citing risks the state's fishery poses to endangered North Atlantic right whales.\n\n\"I put a bill in last year to try and take away all their federal funding because their designation that the Maine lobster fishery is not sustainable because of right whales is not based on science,\" the Maine Democrat told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"If they're going to be a scientific organization that's going to receive federal research dollars, then they should have to actually put out real science,\" he added. \"It's just more bulls--- coming out of these groups who I think \u2014 it has more to do with their fundraising circles and it's a real insular group of people.\"\n\n\"They go in and out of administrations, they work in NOAA, they leave NOAA, they go work at these aquariums, etc.,\" Golden said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhile the Monterey Bay Aquarium has maintained its \"avoid\" red-listing of Maine's lobster fishery, after pressure from Golden, his fellow Maine congressional delegation members, state leaders and industry groups, a bill prohibiting the government from implementing additional regulations targeting the lobster industry for six years was included in the appropriations package President Biden signed into law late last year."}, {"title": "Biden approves Alaska\u2019s Willow drilling operation, but that\u2019s only a small step to stop next energy crisis", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/biden-approves-alaskas-willow-drilling-operation-thats-small-step-stop-energy-crisis", "tag": "OPINION", "content": "NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n\nThis week, the Biden administration issued a long overdue approval of the Willow Project in Alaska\u2019s North Slope, an oil production site within the National Petroleum Reserve.

This is really the first batch of bank records you were able to get because they've been stonewalling you. Are there more?\n\nJAMES COMER: There are many more. Maria, this is one deal. We think there are as many as 11 more deals. Now, we don't know what those deals are with the Bidens. In the beginning, the White House denied having any knowledge or the fact that their family was involved in any sort of way, shape or form with the CCP. But now we have bank records that reveal otherwise. We don't know what the Bidens did in return for this money. The lawyer said that it was C capital for a business. We haven't been able to find a business, Maria. We're going to have an opportunity to ask people about that that were closely aligned with the Biden family. We've talked to him privately. I'm not going to reveal what they say privately, but very soon they'll either be talking to everyone in the form of a deposition or even better in a committee hearing. But right now, it looks like the Biden family just pocketed this money. This is one deal. We have 11 more to go. And I'm pretty confident we'll be getting more bank records in very soon.\n\nMARIA BARTIROMO: All right. So $1 million distributed to the Bidens on one deal, and you say there are 11 others. Let's talk about what possibly the CCP could have been paying for. You're of any indication, whether it be from the laptop, from your investigation, that gives us any information about what specifically China was paying the Biden family for.\n\nJAMES COMER: Well, we know that when the president was vice president in the Obama administration, he made several trips to China. He brought his son and some of these associates with him. They met in different places with some of these people that the president claimed he never met with. So we know the president hasn't been truthful about his involvement when he was vice president. But from talking to former associates that were involved with Hunter Biden, what we know the Biden family had agreed to help China do was get their foot in the door. And the American energy industry not just purchased liquefied natural gas, but also purchased interest in drillers for natural gas, as well as try to do things like help China buy farmland.\n\nBIDEN ON BLAST AFTER HONDURAS JOINS LIST OF COUNTRIES WITH TIES TO CHINA: 'WHERE THERE'S SMOKE, THERE'S FIRE'\n\nJONATHAN TURLEY TELLS MARIA TRUMP\u2019S POSSIBLE INDICTMENT IS \u2018OVERTLY POLITICAL\u2019\n\nMARIA BARTIROMO: So two questions. What does this mean for President Trump? And number two, what are we going to do about these true standards of justice?\n\nJOHN TURLEY: Well. Maria Ironically, if Donald Trump had to choose which of these cases would come first, this would be that case. The this case is overtly political and really fulfills the narrative that many have raised in this campaign season. So in some ways, this is a fortunate decision for Trump. A brag gave Donald Trump what I think is credible evidence of the politicalization of the criminal justice system. There might be a more difficult time doing that with something like Mar a Lago. So the question is what happens to the case? You could not have picked a better jurisdiction to prosecute Donald Trump. You know, this is the worst possible jury pool for him for some judges in New York, to dismiss a case like this would border on self-immolation. So it's possible that this could go to trial. But it's going to have serious problems on appeal. I think that I'm not convinced that Barack has not run out of time. I think there are some very significant questions whether the statute of limitations has already run on these claims.\n\nREP BYRON DONALDS CALLS FOR HEARINGS ON CAPITOL HILL OVER REGULATORS\u2019 TREATMENT OF THE BANKING SYSTEM\n\nMARIA BARTIROMO: Well, I mean, look, a week ago, the FDIC told us that they are going to secure all deposits at Signature Bank, at Silicon Valley Bank. Now, you know, a number of banks want the same treatment of securing all deposits. But you mentioned Mary Daly, the president of the San Francisco Federal Reserve. Kim STRASSEL at The Wall Street Journal writes A great op ed this week Did ESG help sink SBB? Because from day one, this administration has been talking about their climate change agenda, a whole of government approach. And maybe she was rewarding SBB for policies around ESG and around the climate change agenda rather than focusing on the safety of the bank.\n\nCHARLES PAYNE DECONSTRUCTS 'MAJOR EXCUSE' TRUMP DEREGULATION LED TO SILICON VALLEY BANK COLLAPSE\n\nBYRON DONALDS: No, I totally agree with that with that thought process. Mary Daly needs to probably come to Capitol Hill and explain to us what she was looking at and why. Because if you're a solely focused on climate change and equity agendas and all that stuff, but you're not concerned with interest rate risk on the balance sheet of a bank, you're not doing the job. And there are serious questions there about what the regulators were doing and not doing with respect to the soundness of the banking system. But let me also add this, Maria. Let's not absolve the executives at Silicon Valley Bank. They didn't have a risk manager, apparently for eight months. A risk officer excuse me. The C-suite should have known better and done what they needed to do to manage the interest rate risk at the bank going long in treasuries like that and in mortgage backed securities. But we have to make sure you can't let look at the Fed and just give them a pass. In my view, the Federal Reserve took too long trying to get this inflation out of our economy. And now everybody's bearing the the burden of their dithering with respect to handling inflation.\n\nSEN TOM COTTON DISCUSSES WHY THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION PROTECTED CHINESE DEPOSITS\n\nMARIA BARTIROMO: I want to get your take on the FDIC securing all of the deposits of that bank, including importantly, many companies that are based in China that were clients of Silicon Valley Bank. Now they're saying, look, we can't secure all the deposits everywhere. But they were very fast to come to the rescue of Silicon Valley Bank, even with those clients from China. I wonder if it would have been the same treatment if this was a bank in Texas with clients that were oil companies or oil, you know, trading firms.\n\nTOM COTTON: Well, Maria, just ask the question I think is carrying with it its own answer. I think it's obvious to everyone that Joe Biden would not have bailed out a bank in, say, Midland, Texas, that banked almost exclusively the oil and gas industry. The failure of Silicon Valley Bank and the stress it's put on our banking sector and the economy really has Joe Biden's failures all the way down. It was Joe Biden's reckless spending that created runaway inflation, which led to higher interest rates, which put the squeeze on banks like Silicon Valley Bank. And it was Joe Biden's administration that didn't properly oversee and supervise a bank like Silicon Valley Bank six months ago or a year ago to ensure that they were doing proper risk management of the interest rate spreads between their deposits on the one hand and their assets on the other hand, or for that matter, who last week didn't help arrange for a shotgun wedding merger with a larger bank with a more stable balance sheet, probably because they're ideologically opposed to any kind of mergers. So what we got instead was the Biden bank bailout, which will in fact be going to Chinese companies, because it's well known that Silicon Valley Bank was an access point for Chinese companies to get American money. And when you have one of these bank failures, foreign depositors are supposed to be in line behind American depositors. Yet the Biden administration confirmed to me on a conference call last week about this situation that they are, in fact, going to make whole Chinese depositors probably on the fig leaf that they have, you know, a single American cosigner, most likely at the very venture capital firms that were funneling money into these Chinese companies in the first place. Companies that are almost certainly in most cases aligned with the Chinese Communist Party or the People's Liberation Army.\n\nJOHN RATCLIFFE TELLS MARIA BARTIROMO THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE FOR TRUMP SINCE THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION BEGAN\n\nMARIA BARTIROMO: President Trump says he's going to be arrested on Tuesday. Your reaction?\n\nLEGAL EXPERT TORCHES MANHATTAN DA'S POTENTIAL TRUMP ARREST: 'BANANA REPUBLIC SORT OF STUFF'\n\nJOHN RATCLIFFE: Well, it's clearly a political prosecution, and that's underscored by the fact, Maria, that you have in Melvyn Bragg, the D.A. involved here, someone who on his very first day in office said we will not prosecute armed robberies in this office. And now he's saying we will prosecute a misdemeanor offense against the opposition political party who happens to be a presidential candidate, former President of the United States, despite the fact that the statute of limitations has clearly run on that misdemeanor and the fact that other state and federal prosecutors have passed on that. So. But my take on it, Maria, is this is just the latest in sort of the evolution of of what the Democrats, as they have shifted from a party, from Democrats to progressives, which is really kind of a mix of socialists and communists who don't like the American justice system. It's a continuation of an assault on that justice system and tearing down all of the pillars that make that system work so well. So just to remind your viewers, when the Mueller investigation was going, the first of the pillars to go was the bedrock principle of a presumption of innocence. Remember, Donald Trump didn't have that presumption. He had to conclusively prove his innocence. Then quickly, it shifted in the Ukraine impeachment to the suspension of the principle of due process of law. And Donald Trump became the first president never to be allowed to have legal representation throughout the House proceedings. More recently, with Mar a Lago, the next principle to go was equal protection under the law. And we saw that when the same statute was applied between Trump and Biden. Regarding classified documents, Trump's home was raided. Biden's lawyers were allowed to just casually turn over documents whenever they want. So this latest sort of tortured prosecution that is in the offing this week by by the day in New York is just sort of the latest assault on the American justice system by the Democratic Party.\n\nSEN RICK SCOTT WARNS OF THE DOUBLE-STANDARD IN OUR SYSTEM OF JUSTICE\n\nMARIA BARTIROMO: Senator, where is the outrage from Republicans?

She cites a grand total of two academic studies on the topic. This is disingenuous at best and a lie of omission at worst.\n\nLet us offer up an analogy. Weingarten\u2019s argument is akin to saying that Hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin are lifesavers in the battle against COVID-19. Sure, one could find a supportive study here or there, but that doesn\u2019t tell us whether most high-quality studies show that. They don\u2019t. And neither does most of the research show that unions raise student achievement.\n\nDESPITE YOUNGKIN WINNING ON EDUCATION REFORM, VA TEACHERS UNION FINDS WAY TO BYPASS CRT BAN\n\nBut don\u2019t take our word for it. In a comprehensive literature review on teachers unions and student achievement published by the Economics of Education Review, Michigan State University professors Katharine Strunk and Josh Cowen concluded that \"the evidence for union-related differences in student outcomes is mixed, but suggestive of insignificant or modestly negative union effects.\"\n\nA few years later, Cornell University economists Michael Lovenheim and Alexander Will\u00e9n conducted one of the most sophisticated and innovative studies on the topic of unions, examining the long-run effects of collective bargaining on students\u2019 later life outcomes. Remarkably, these scholars found that boys who spent more of their childhood in a unionized classroom had lower (four percent) earnings and reduced labor force participation rates as adults.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all. A year after the Cornell team\u2019s study, Michigan State\u2019s Strunk and Cowen reanalyzed the research on teachers unions. This time they offered an even stronger endorsement of the union rent-seeking hypothesis. \"Because\u2026 unions may drive up [school] district costs\u2026 we conclude that at the time of this writing an evidence-based appraisal of union impacts supports the notion that union priorities (especially those won at the bargaining table) do not necessarily align with academic success in the classroom.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThis evidence shouldn't surprise anyone. They are the teachers' union, after all, not the kids' union.\n\nBut once again, don\u2019t take our word for it. In the past, union leaders have sometimes been candid about these dynamics. In 1997, for example, the president of the nation\u2019s largest teachers union (the NEA) acknowledged in a speech at the National Press Club that, \"in some instances,\" the union had, \"used its power to block uncomfortable changes to protect the narrow interest of our members, and not to advance the interests of students and schools.\"\n\nRandi Weingarten must know her claim is bogus. That\u2019s probably why she closed her replies \u2013 like she closed the schools \u2013 when she tweeted out her opinion piece. If she really believed her claim were true, then she wouldn\u2019t be so terrified of a little school choice competition, either.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTo be sure, unions are not solely to blame for everything that ails American education. But as Stanford University\u2019s Terry Moe explained long ago, \"Some things are obvious. It is not good for children that ineffective teachers cannot be removed from the classroom. It is not good for children that teachers cannot be assigned\u2026 where they are needed most. It is not good for children that excellent young teachers get laid off before mediocre [senior] colleagues. Yet these are features of\u2026 American schooling that the unions fight for, in their own interests.\"\n\nThose are some important additional facts to consider, but don\u2019t expect Weingarten to be honest about them.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY MICHAEL HARTNEY\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY COREY DEANGELIS\n\nCorey DeAngelis is a senior fellow at the American Federation for Children."}, {"title": "Credit Suisse: Imperiled global investment bank has CCP-tied official on risk committee", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/credit-suisse-imperiled-global-investment-bank-ccp-tied-official-risk-committee", "tag": "CHINA", "content": "One of the world's largest financial institutions teetering on a full-blown crisis has a Chinese Communist Party-linked individual on its risk management team.\n\nOn Wednesday, Swiss bank Credit Suisse's value plummeted nearly 30%, forcing trading to be abruptly halted midday, after it acknowledged in its annual report it had \"material weakness\" and its largest investor, a Saudi state-run bank, said it couldn't provide additional assistance, citing a \"regulatory issue.\"\n\nThen, on Thursday, Credit Suisse said it intended to borrow a staggering $54 billion from the Swiss National Bank as an unprecedented lifeline to boost its liquidity.\n\n\"These measures demonstrate decisive action to strengthen Credit Suisse as we continue our strategic transformation to deliver value to our clients and other stakeholders,\" CEO Ulrich Koerner said in a statement. \"My team and I are resolved to move forward rapidly to deliver a simpler and more focused bank built around client needs.\"\n\nCREDIT SUISSE SHEDS NEARLY 25%, KEY BACKER SAYS NO MORE MONEY\n\nAccording to its website, though, Shan Li, an individual with extensive ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), has been a board member of the bank with senior roles on its risk management team, Asia advisory council and compensation committee since 2019.\n\nCredit Suisse's website also boasts of Li's wide-ranging experience with Chinese government-affiliated companies.

ESG stands for environmental, social and governance and those considerations have become more prominent in investing in recent years, sparking a nationwide backlash from conservative Republicans.\n\nThe Kansas Senate's version of the anti-ESG measure would require private money managers to get their clients' written consent before investing their funds along ESG principles. The House bill contains no such provision.\n\nWHAT ESG INVESTING IS, AND WHY SOME POLITICIANS ARE AGAINST IT\n\nThe issue of requiring managers of private funds to disclose their ESG activities to clients or to get clients' verbal or written consent to use them appears to be the last major sticking point among Republicans in the GOP-controlled Legislature.

Instead, they encourage being more comprehensive about assessing investment risks, such as whether concerns about climate change make green energy more attractive and fossil fuels less so. They also argue that Republicans have turned ESG into a culture war issue to keep the GOP's conservative base riled up.\n\nIn Kansas, Democrats argue that anti-ESG legislation is unnecessary because state law already requires its managers to work to get the maximum investment returns possible.

According to experts, though, the regulations impacting everything from water heaters and furnaces to clothes washers and dishwashers could ultimately be counterproductive.\n\n\"What these mandates, what these standards, do is enforce a level of efficiency that doesn't make sense,\" Ben Lieberman, a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, told Fox News Digital in an interview. \"And they compromise product quality.

A month later, the agency began moving forward on more than a dozen energy efficiency rules, impacting a wide range of appliances.\n\nAnd the administration has continued introducing appliance regulations this year, unveiling rules in February that would restrict which cooking stoves, ovens, refrigerators and clothes washers consumers can purchase. The DOE said the efficiency rules would save consumers billions of dollars and \"significantly reduce pollution\" contributing to climate change.\n\nDEMOCRAT-LED CITIES ARE ALREADY MOVING FORWARD WITH GAS STOVE BANS THAT WILL AFFECT MILLIONS\n\n\"It should be up to the individual user as far as how much they choose to save,\" Travis Fisher, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation's Center for Energy, Climate and Environment, told Fox News Digital. \"The concept of a mandate really comes from the idea that the government knows better than the end user of what kind of appliances they should be buying. I don't buy into that premise at all.\"\n\nLike Fisher, Lieberman noted that manufacturers have already increased the overall efficiency of products and that consumers are free to make informed decisions based on what is available to them. He said mandating more restrictions will force prices higher and could lead to less effectiveness, thereby wasting more energy.\n\n\"These standards are counterproductive from the energy and environmental savings standpoint, but they're also a real inconvenience for consumers,\" said Lieberman. \"They're not so convenient because you might have to do things more than once. Even if you do things once, your clothes washer and dishwasher cycle times are already longer.\"\n\nHe added that the standards could result in dirtier clothes and dishes, forcing consumers to either run a second cycle or wash by hand, which would both waste more energy overall than current models.\n\nA former senior DOE official argued the supposed savings from more-efficient appliances, which the Biden administration has touted as a main benefit of regulations, are minimal and often don't outweigh their higher price.\n\nBIDEN'S ENERGY SECRETARY MET WITH CHINA-CONNECTED GROUP FUELING GAS STOVE BANS IN US\n\n\"Their philosophy is energy efficiency at all costs or energy efficiency no matter the cost,\" the official told Fox News Digital. \"That means we are going to see, as a result of their efficiency standards, higher-priced appliances. It's that simple.\n\n\"The reality is that we are not talking about saving huge amounts of energy from these new regulations.\"\n\nFor example, a recently released clothes washer model made by LG costs $10 per year in energy costs while a less-efficient, but lower-priced model also made by LG costs $16 per year, according to DOE data. Consumers may choose to pay the extra $6 per year in exchange for a more effective machine, the former DOE official said.\n\nThe comments from experts come after the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM), the leading U.S. trade group representing appliance makers and suppliers, issued a warning of its own, saying the DOE's recent clothes washer regulations \"would have a disproportionate, negative impact on low-income households\" by eliminating cheaper appliances from the market.\n\nAHAM has also argued that the administration's appliance regulations targeting seven key areas \u2014 cooking, refrigerators and freezers, miscellaneous refrigeration, clothes washers, clothes dryers, microwave ovens and room air conditioners \u2014 will result in worse products.\n\nBIDEN ADMIN CRACKS DOWN ON WASHERS, FRIDGES IN LATEST CLIMATE ACTION: 'OVERREGULATION ON STEROIDS'\n\n\"There are seven that relate to home appliances, but it affects all major categories,\" Jill Notini, a spokesperson for AHAM, said in an interview. \"The cumulative cost to manufacturers of all the major rules adds up to more than $2.25 billion. And this is really what we believe is just the tipping point of the impact.\"\n\n\"The consumer bears the real burden here. Clothes washers are expected, under the new rules that the U.S. is proposing, to cost $150 more than they do today. And consumers will save about $7 a year,\" she continued. \"These savings really just don't add up right now during this time of high inflation.\"\n\nNotini added that the DOE standards would force a staggering 98% of the top-loading clothes washer products currently being sold off the market within four years.\n\nShe also pointed to figures showing the industry has already improved efficiency by 70% over the last 20 years, while machines have gotten 50% larger on average.\n\n\"These are all policies that have very good intentions behind them for the environment,\" Notini continued. \"But they don't make sense for the consumer and it's not going to make sense in the end because people are likely to run double cycles in order to achieve the same performance that they have from today's products.\"\n\n\"We will continue to work collaboratively with the DOE. Energy efficiency is due to a combination of innovation and standards. But we are the people that make the products and we understand what consumer needs are,\" she said. \"We want to continue to make them energy efficient, but we need to be able to continue to make high-performing appliances with the features that people desire at the cost that they can afford.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Energy Department, however, pushed back on criticism it has received related to its regulations on appliances, saying it aimed to promote cost savings without sacrificing effectiveness.\n\n\"Despite misleading claims to the contrary, these proposals are intended for nothing more than promoting innovation and keeping money in the pockets of Americans everywhere without sacrificing the reliability and performance that consumers expect and rely on,\" a DOE spokesperson told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"As evidenced in the Department\u2019s testing and analysis, the proposed standards would not reduce product performance or negatively impact cleaning ability or cycle time.\"\n\nFox News Digital's Matteo Cina contributed to this report."}, {"title": "Tampa is top of mind: Where to go, what to eat, and why you should visit before it's too late", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/tampa-top-mind-where-go-what-eat-why-you-should-visit-before-too-late", "tag": "LIFESTYLE", "content": "Tampa is strutting these days with pride, purpose and freedom.\n\nThe largest city on Florida's Gulf Coast has enjoyed an economic and popularity surge at least a decade in the making.\n\nThe lid blew off the top of Tampa\u2019s simmering ascendancy three years ago.\n\nNFL legend and gossip-page headline maker Tom Brady landed in Tampa in 2020, shining a bright new spotlight on the city.

It was the second-biggest bank failure in United States history after the collapse of Washington Mutual in 2008. Two days later, Signature Bank in New York was closed by federal regulators over concerns of a bank run, sparking fears of a wider financial crisis.\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, which passed in 2010 under the Obama administration in the aftermath of the Great Recession, set tougher regulatory safeguards on banks with assets worth over $50 billion. SVB lobbied heavily for the passage of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, which passed in 2018 under the Trump administration and raised the asset threshold to $250 billion.\n\nProminent Democrats, including President Biden, have blamed the bill for contributing to the current banking crisis.\n\nSEN. KENNEDY SAYS SVB BAILOUT COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED: \u2018BONE DEEP, DOWN-TO-THE-MARROW STUPID\u2019\n\n\"During the Obama-Biden administration, we put in place tough requirements on banks, like Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, including the Dodd-Frank law to make sure that the crisis we saw in 2008 would not happen again,\" the president said Monday. \"Unfortunately, the last administration rolled back some of these requirements. I\u2019m going to ask Congress and the banking regulators to strengthen the rules for banks to make it less likely this kind of bank failure would happen again and to protect American jobs and small businesses.\"\n\nThe 2018 bill was able to pass both chambers of Congress with 16 Senate Democrats and 33 House Democrats voting in favor. Of those 49 Democrats, at least 23 received campaign contributions from SVB, its CEO and its lobbyists.\n\nThe campaign for Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., for instance, received a total of $19,200 from Franklin Square Group consultants and longtime SVB lobbyists Matthew Tanielian, Joshua Ackil and Brian Peters between 2009 and 2018, according to Federal Election Commission records. His campaign also received $6,500 from Silicon Valley Bank PAC and SVB Financial Group PAC between 2012 and 2017.\n\nThe campaign for Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., received a total of $21,200 from Tanielian and Ackil between 2010 and 2017. He received $19,100 from Silicon Valley Bank PAC and its parent SVB Financial Group PAC between 2011 and 2017.\n\nThe campaign for Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., received a total of $11,800 from Tanielian and Ackil between 2012 and 2017.

Tim Kaine, D-Va., received a total of $7,500 from Tanielian between 2011 and 2017 and $2,500 from Ackil in 2011.\n\nThe campaign for Rep. Jim Costa, D-Calif., received a $1,000 contribution from SVB President and CEO Greg Becker in February 2016.\n\nThe campaign committee for Rep. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., received a $1,000 contribution from Silicon Valley Bank PAC in 2017 and a total of $4,000 in contributions from Ackil between 2015 and 2018.\n\nThe campaign for Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., received $3,000 from SVB Financial Group PAC between 2009 and 2012, a total of $2,500 from Ackil from 2010 to 2013, and $1,500 from Tanielian from 2010 to 2012.\n\nThe campaign for Sen.

Rick Larsen, D-Wash., received a total of $3,000 from Peters between 2009 and 2016, and he received $1,000 from Ackil and $500 from Tanielian in 2011.\n\nSen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., received a total of $4,000 from Tanielian and Ackil between 2012 and 2015.\n\nOther Democrat senators who voted for the 2018 legislation and received contributions from Tanielian, Ackil or Peters, albeit nominal amounts, include Sen.

Ron Kind, D-Wisc., also received contributions from Silicon Valley Bank PAC and the SVB lobbyists before the 2018 vote.\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, at least 16 Republicans who voted for the 2018 bill received thousands in contributions from Silicon Valley Bank PAC prior to the vote, but not from the individual lobbyists, including House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., and Sen. Portman, R-Ohio., among others.\n\nFranklin Square Group and the campaigns named did not respond to Fox News Digital's requests for comment.\n\nPost-2018, SVB\u2019s California executives and PAC have been busy propping up a handful of politicians, which has primarily benefited Democratic lawmakers prior to the bank\u2019s collapse last week that has sent ripples throughout the banking industry.

Warner and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer during the 2022 midterm election cycle. Schumer has since pledged to return all SVB-related contributions.\n\nBecker also gave $2,500 to the New Democrat Coalition Action Fund in May last year.

The truth has already been defined that these are the problems, and here are the solutions,\" said Oaks, according to the Salt Lake Tribune. \"The debate is over.\"\n\nOaks then invoked the biblical \"war in Heaven\" from the Book of Revelation, calling it another \"outcomes-based\" initiative.\n\nGOP PUSHBACK TO 'WOKE' ESG INVESTING BEGINS TO BEAR FRUIT\n\n\"Outcomes-based governance like the U.N.'s SDGs and ESG opens the door to authoritarianism,\" said Oaks. \"It is Satan's plan.\"\n\nESG, short for environmental, social, and governance investing, is based on the concept that investors should use these three broad categories when evaluating where to put their money, prioritizing progressive values and \"social responsibility\" when making financial decisions.\n\nWhen asked for clarification about his remarks, a spokesperson for Oaks told the Tribune that the issues raised by ESG are important and should be debated.\n\n\"Treasurer Oaks said his use of scripture was an attempt to speak to an audience that might understand the example and illustrate the problem with systems that attempt to push outcomes on everyone,\" the spokesperson said. \"His opposition is to coercion as a mechanism in society.\"\n\nOaks is one of several experts and policymakers who have criticized ESG for seeking to achieve policy objectives by bypassing legislatures and the democratic process in order to impose them.\n\nCORPORATE WOKENESS: BIG TECH, MAJOR BANKS RATED 'HIGH RISK' OF CANCELING PEOPLE, ORGS FOR IDEOLOGICAL REASONS\n\n\"ESG promotes and implements policies through private businesses that could be adopted through a legislative process,\" Oaks said in an interview last year. \"The Green New Deal didn't make it through Congress, so its proponents shifted the battlefield to the capital markets.\"\n\nESG has become a politically explosive issue over the past couple years.\n\nThe theory underpinning ESG is that corporations should deemphasize their traditional responsibility to maximize value for shareholders and instead make new commitments to alternative stakeholder groups, serving other interests and society at large.\n\nMany investors now use ESG as a rating system to measure a company's advancement of policies designed to address climate change, increase corporate board demographic diversity, and support a progressive \"social justice\" agenda, among other initiatives.\n\nSENATE KILLS BIDEN ESG INVESTMENT RULE IN STUNNING REBUKE\n\nHowever, critics of what they describe as \"corporate wokeness\" have been mobilizing against the march of ESG advocates, arguing the financial movement is a way to push left-wing causes through business rather than the legislature.\n\nLast April, Oaks coordinated an effort by political leaders across the state to send a letter to S&P Global Ratings President and CEO Douglas Peterson demanding that S&P withdraw ESG indicators as a factor in its credit ratings for states and state subdivisions.\n\n\"ESG is about controlling and forcing behaviors,\" Oaks said in a statement at the time. \"It attempts to do through capital markets what activists and their government allies have been unable to do through democratic processes. S&P should be concerned about whether investors will get paid back, not whether a state policy lines up with their political beliefs, whatever those may be.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMonths later, Oaks pulled about $100 million in state funds from the giant investment firm BlackRock, one of corporate America's biggest promoters of ESG.\n\nAt the federal level, the Senate earlier this month passed a resolution killing a Biden administration rule that encourages managers to consider ESG factors when making investment decisions for the retirement funds of over 150 million Americans."}, {"title": "Top casino union boss to leave Atlantic City", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/top-casino-union-boss-leave-atlantic-city", "tag": "NEW JERSEY", "content": "He's led Atlantic City casino workers through three strikes, been arrested at protests nearly 10 times, and won workers including housekeepers, cocktail servers and others the best contract they had ever had.\n\nNow Bob McDevitt is stepping down as president of the main union for Atlantic City casino workers, Local 54 of Unite Here, after 26 years as one of the most powerful people in Atlantic City, able to bring the industry to its knees when he felt workers were being treated unfairly.\n\nIt is a power that he has used repeatedly; sometimes, the mere threat of a strike prompted casinos to sign a new contract.\n\nIN NEW JERSEY, CANCER-STRICKEN CASINO DEALERS PUSH FOR ATLANTIC CITY SMOKING BAN\n\n\"We represent people who traditionally have not been what you would consider high-wage workers \u2014 housekeepers, bartenders, cocktail servers, people who clean public areas,\" he said. \"It's one thing to work as a waiter over the summer while you're in college; it's quite another to try to support yourself and a family on that. That's where we come in.\"\n\nThe union represents about 10,000 workers in Atlantic City who have been able to live a middle-class existence doing jobs that typically pay less in other industries.\n\nPugnacious and gregarious, quick with a joke and even quicker with a profanity, McDevitt was a fixture in Atlantic City who exerted his influence over local and state elected officials on matters affecting Atlantic City and its casinos. During protests, he sat down in roadways and blocked traffic; during Boardwalk rallies, he yelled into bullhorns.\n\nTwo years ago, he nearly died from a systemic infection that developed from a cut on his foot, which led to its amputation. But he recovered in time to help negotiate a new contract last year providing significant raises, and maintaining health care and pension benefits, including a $22 hourly wage for housekeepers in the final year of the four-year deal.\n\nThe new contract was reached without the union going on strike. Previously, walkouts were staged in 1999, 2004 and 2016.\n\nThe 2004 walkout, mainly over casinos' use of non-union subcontractors, lasted 34 days. But the 2016 strike was the most rancorous and controversial: It led to the closure of the Trump Taj Mahal casino, which at the time was owned by billionaire investor Carl Icahn.\n\nThat strike centered on the union's demand that Icahn restore health insurance and pension benefits that a bankruptcy court judge had terminated. Icahn offered to restore health insurance to Taj Mahal workers, but at a level less than what workers at the city\u2019s other casinos received, which the union rejected.\n\nIcahn closed the casino on Oct. 10, 2016, saying he had lost $100 million while operating it; about 3,000 workers lost their jobs.\n\n\"It was very much a fight to the death,\" McDevitt said. \"If we had capitulated to them, that would have been pivotal. Every other casino would have wanted the same deal.\"\n\nHe said workers realized either they or the casino would survive \u2014 but not both.\n\n\"Everybody has their Popeye moment: \u2018That\u2019s all I can stands; I can\u2019t stands no more,\u2019\" he said on the day the casino closed. \"The workers made a choice that they weren\u2019t going to accept benefits and terms of employment worse than everyone else\u2019s. I applaud them.\"\n\nMcDevitt endured heavy criticism in some quarters for allowing \u2014 some say forcing \u2014 the casino to close. But he says the reopening of the casino as Hard Rock less than two years later vindicates the decision to let the Taj Mahal go under.\n\nBORGATA SETS ATLANTIC CITY'S MONTHLY RECORD IN JULY WITH $124 MILLION IN WINNINGS\n\nMcDevitt called Hard Rock's Global Chair Jim Allen the best casino executive who he has ever worked with, citing the company's pay, bonuses and the overall way it treats its workers.\n\nJoe Lupo, the former president of Hard Rock in Atlantic City \u2014 the former Taj Mahal building \u2014 said McDevitt was easy to get along with.\n\n\"I always enjoyed working with Bob, as he was very cooperative, direct, never minced words, but with a great sense of humor,\" said Lupo, who now runs the former Mirage casino in Las Vegas for Hard Rock. \"More importantly, he was very passionate and genuinely cares for each member, always prioritizing their future and welfare first.\"\n\nMcDevitt said the worst casino executive he encountered was Bill Yung, who was head of Kentucky-based Columbia Sussex Corp. That company owned the Tropicana in 2007 and allowed conditions to deteriorate to such an extent that New Jersey gambling regulators stripped the company of its casino license, forcing its sale.

The law, enacted in 2012 when Republicans fully controlled Michigan government, prohibits public and private unions from requiring that nonunion employees pay union dues even if the union bargains on their behalf.\n\nSenators approved the repeal on a 20-17 vote, sending it back to the House, which passed its own version last week but must approve the final language. Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has said she'll sign it.

Thomas Albert, the lone Republican on the committee, said during the meeting that the repeal would allow \"forced union membership.\"\n\nSpending appropriations were attached to both bills, a move that Republicans say is to ensure they are \"referendum-proof.\" The Michigan Constitution states that bills with appropriations attached to them are not subject to a public referendum in which voters could reject the law.\n\nWhitmer promised in her 2019 State of the State speech to \"veto bills designed to cut out the public\u2019s right of referendum.\" Her office has said that while she didn\u2019t ask for the appropriation to be added, \"the governor is going to sign a bill that puts Michigan\u2019s working families first.\"\n\nOpponents could still protect the policy by putting a constitutional amendment on the ballot, which would require close to 450,000 voter signatures. A ballot measure barring \"right-to-work\" laws was defeated by nearly 14 percentage points in 2012.\n\nMichigan had the nation\u2019s seventh-highest percentage of unionized workers when the \"right-to-work\" law was enacted in 2012, but that dropped to 11th in 2022.

Scott Walker proposed all-but ending collective bargaining for most public workers. It sent off weeks of protests that grew to as large as 100,000 people and led Democratic state senators to leave the state in a failed attempt to stop the bill\u2019s passage.\n\nFour years later, after he had said he wouldn\u2019t go after union rights of private sector workers, Walker signed a right-to-work law for Wisconsin."}, {"title": "'Mr. Wonderful' torches 'idiot' bankers, says feds' SVB response 'nationalized the banking system'", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/media/mr-wonderful-torches-idiot-bankers-bidens-svb-nationalized-banking-system", "tag": "FOX NEWS FLASH", "content": "Canadian-American investor Kevin O'Leary called out the \"idiot bank managers\" who led Silicon Valley Bank to its demise, further adding that the federal government's response to the collapse unwisely \"nationalized\" the banking system.\n\nO'Leary, well-known by his \"Mr. Wonderful\" nickname coined on \"Shark Tank\" by fellow investor Barbara Corcoran, told \"Hannity\" that he however doesn't like playing politics, especially in terms of finance.\n\n\"When you're in my situation, you don't care that much about politics, you care about policy,\" he said.\n\n\"And so you make your decisions every day \u2013 my job is to get up in the morning and put millions of dollars to work.

Last year, the group \u2014 which has commitments from companies like Blue Apron, Cheesecake Factory, Hello Fresh and Whole Foods \u2014 downgraded Maine lobster from \"good alternative\" to \"avoid,\" citing risks the state's fishery poses to endangered North Atlantic right whales.\n\n\"They conducted this inquiry, this analysis, based on what they characterized as all scientific data and a rigorous and transparent science-based process.

Why is the U.S. government so deeply in debt? How does Wall Street get so much money? What do they do exactly? Why are housing prices so high? Why do our leaders stoke racial conflict? Why have so many Americans concluded that their system is rigged? In every case, the answers to those questions is the same. It all began in 2008. Now, 2008 and its aftermath is a complex story, but let's just sum up in the broadest possible terms what happened.\n\nBig financial institutions took foolish risks and nearly blew up the entire U.S. economy. We knew right away what had happened and who did it, but nobody was ever punished. The reckless bankers responsible got off; so did the politicians who encouraged the reckless bankers to be reckless. Nobody went to jail. Nobody was even banished from the industry. In fact, some of the wrongdoers even got their bonuses that year. So, we had an economic collapse, but it didn't hurt them at all.\n\nWhy? Well, simple. The government bailed out the banks. That was controversial, but bipartisan and at the time, they told us in bipartisan fashion that they were saving capitalism. But they weren't. In fact, they were inverting capitalism.\n\nBIDEN ADMIN'S RESPONSE TO SILICON VALLEY BANK COLLAPSE IS THE 'GREATEST FORM OF CORPORATE CRONYISM': TIM SCOTT\n\nWhat happened next is very simple. Wall Street was allowed to privatize its gains but socialize its risks. That meant if things went well, the finance people got rich, in fact, richer than any group in human history, but if things went south, the government, you, would swoop in to save them \u2013 pretty good deal. But for more than a decade, very few complained about this arrangement because things went very, very well. Wall Street boomed and the root of Wall Street's success, no matter what they tell you, was low interest rates, not new innovation, low interest rates. Low interest rates make a bull market inevitable.\n\nSo, in a normal, non-distorted capitalist economy, companies become valuable, more valuable, when they produce more goods and services that people want to buy. But in an economy controlled by monetary policy run by the Federal Reserve, companies become valuable when interest rates decline.\n\nFor 13 years, interest rates remained near zero. In retrospect, now that it's ended, this was crazy behavior. These were emergency measures declared by the Federal Reserve after 2008, but they never ended. And because they never ended for 13 years, the American economy was distorted beyond recognition in ways too numerous to count. Venture capital and private equity exploded, and so did cryptocurrency, so did asset prices, particularly real estate.\n\nThere was an ocean of money flooding the system, and the people who pay half the tax rate you do benefited most. They started buying third houses and flying private. But there was also a problem that you didn't hear a lot about with low interest rates. If interest rates were at zero, how do you get meaningful returns on your money? This was a problem that virtually every investor faced for more than a decade, very much including the banks. At some point, investors became tempted to make very risky bets. If they wanted to produce returns, they had to.\n\nAs they say on Wall Street, \"Tina, there is no option.\" One of the risky bets that banks made was loading up on long-term Treasury bonds from the U.S. government as a surrogate for cash, though, of course, bonds are not cash. They're different from cash, as we're now learning, but that worked fine as long as interest rates remained low. But once interest rates rose as a response to inflation as obviously they were always going to do. (Nothing lasts forever, including zero interest rates). Once that happened, those bonds were worth less than the banks had paid for them and so the banks began to fail. You are seeing that right now.\n\nSILICON VALLEY BANK HAD MORE RED FLAGS THAN A CCP MEETING BUT REGULATORS CARED ABOUT CLIMATE NOT BANK RISKS\n\nYou're also seeing, revealed for everyone to see, the other effect of 13 years of artificial Fed-driven prosperity, and that is a lot of silly, frivolous people in charge. They're like inherited money people: They think they earned it, but they didn't. Because when money is free from the Fed, you don't have to be a serious person to get rich. You can do whatever you want because there's no consequence. You can put BLM logos on your website. You can spend investor funds on female empowerment ski weekends in Tahoe. When interest rates are zero, you can do anything because making money is easy. Everybody is a genius. Anyone can do it, and unfortunately, a lot of very stupid people did do it.\n\nOn Friday, as you know, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) failed. That became the second-largest bank failure in American history. Then on Sunday, authorities took over Signature Bank in New York \u2013 that became the third-largest bank failure in American history.\n\nThen today, shortly after the markets opened, trading in several regional banks had to be halted. Western Alliance was down almost 80%. First Republic, which of course, Jim Cramer endorsed just a few days ago on CNBC, that was down nearly 70%. Jim Cramer is always welcome to come on this show for amusement purposes. PacWest, down 50%, Comerica down 40% and so on.\n\nThere was panic, of course, reflected in markets and it wasn't just regional banks that were affected. For a while this morning, you could not even trade stock in Charles Schwab, venerable Charles Schwab, Schwab, it down 25% and tripped a circuit breaker. That's bad. In fact, that kind of panic could quickly conceivably become a catastrophe. On the brink of catastrophe, you need one thing \u2013 strong, competent leadership. But we don't have that. We have Joe Biden. Today, he shuffled out to the podium and announced a bailout .\n\nBILLIONAIRE INVESTOR CARL ICAHN ON SVB COLLAPSE: THE PROBLEM WITH THE SYSTEM IS WE ISSUE TOO MUCH CAPITAL\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: I want to briefly speak about what's happened to the Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank today. Thanks to the quick action of my administration, over the past few days, Americans can have confidence that the banking system is safe. Deposits will be there when you need them. Small businesses across the country, the deposit accounts at these banks can breathe easier, knowing they'll be able to pay their workers and pay their bills.\n\nAll right. So, the money the Biden administration is using for this bailout apparently is coming from the FDIC. So, the feds have it covered. Don't worry about the details. Everything's totally fine.\n\nHold on. Slow down, pal. How did this happen? Can we get an explanation for that? Don't we have regulators and how did those regulators, since we're pretty confident they exist, are taking big salaries, how did they miss the fact that SVB was insolvent, Apparently for months and not in some complex credit default swap way? You're going to spend 5,000 words trying to understand, but in a really simple way that's easy to understand. Their liabilities were bigger than their assets. Very simple. How did nobody notice that, the people were paid to notice it? Well, Joe Biden, unfortunately answered none of those questions. He just ran for the door.\n\nBIDEN: Thank you. God bless you and may God protect our troops. See you in in California.\n\nREPORTER: Mr. President, what do you know right now about why this happened and can you assure Americans that there won't be a ripple effect?\n\nREPORTER: Do you expect other banks to fail, Mr. President?\n\nREPORTER: Should all depositors be protected at all banks?\n\nWHITE HOUSE AIDE: All right, thank you, everybody. OK.\n\nDo we know why this happened. He is trying to figure out how to work the doorknob.\n\nWhat we know is the Biden administration is backstopping these deposits. OK, but that's not the end of the story. In some ways, it's the beginning. Here's the part where you pause and ask yourself a question that too few seem to be considering right now. They're doing this. What are they going to get in return? Something for sure.\\\n\nRemember that after 2008, the Obama administration, Eric Holder, swooped in and imposed DEI \u2013 diversity, equity and inclusion standards \u2013 on the entire financial sector and that's one of the main reasons are big banks are now increasingly incompetent and also one of the reasons Americans are so divided by race. Ideologues used the 2008 bank bailout to kill American meritocracy. That's a big step, mostly unacknowledged, but we're living with its consequences.\n\nYou have to ask yourself, what are they going to do this time? Well, we know we're about to see bank consolidation, big banks eating little banks and that means less competition. More consolidation means more government control.\n\nWhat are they going to do with that control? Well, all things being equal, if people don't start making a lot of noise and exerting an awful lot of pressure, it'll mean digital currency, a currency that politicians control. Sign up for the CBCC app to get your food stamps.\n\nYou think that's not coming? Of course, it's coming. They'd like it to come. In any case. Now, we're not alleging a conspiracy here, but we did notice that the four biggest banks, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, are doing well. And we also noticed the White House appears to be, maybe we're just reading into this too much, trying to induce runs on regional banks?\n\nSILICON VALLEY BANK WAS FOCUSED ON CREATING THE WRONG KIND OF 'SAFE SPACE': KENNEDY\n\nThey seem to be trying to take away your confidence in those banks. Here's Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, not someone ever accused of having an original thought, but she's a vessel for the plans of others. Here she is on Friday as SVB was collapsing. Now, she doesn't say a word about the fundamentals of the market or the security of your money in banks. Instead, she talks about the one thing that matters to her, which is the racial identity of the people in charge of our finance system. Watch.\n\nKARINE JEAN-PIERRE: I do want to take a moment to note the historic nature of the moment that you see in front of you right now. All three of us are historic first in our roles, the first Black woman to serve as CEO, chair, OMB director, White House press secretary. The first Black woman right in front of you for all of those three important, important, key roles in the administration.\n\nThese people lack all self-awareness. As if anyone would care! Why should we care? Is there some reason to care? By the way, you are discrediting by your stupidity and clear incompetence, anything you're promoting. You should keep that in mind.\n\nBut big picture, if you want to make people less confident in regional banks and the banking system more broadly, if you want it to maybe induce a run on the banks, this might be how you talk. Oh, we're all of a certain racial group. Huh? What does it have to do with whether the banks have enough cash in reserve to cover their balance sheets?\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSo, what we do know is that the Democratic Party, the Biden administration, sees this crisis as a means of expanding their control. And we know this because in a recent Zoom call with the Fed, Treasury Department, other financial regulators with members of Congress, Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona asked whether there was a program in place to censor social media posts that could lead to a national run on banks and that's according to Congressman Thomas Massie. Michael Shellenberger is a great piece on this today. Massie was on the call. So, think about this for a second.\n\nYou've got a deposit at a regional bank that's holding tons, way more than you know of, long-term treasuries that are worth a lot less than they were when the bank bought them. That means that bank is at risk. That means your money is at risk, but Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona doesn't want you to know about that. Why wouldn't they want you to know that?\n\nKind of interesting. That kind of censorship could actually crush people. We have to ask the obvious question: How close are we to some sort of disaster and to what extent are the people in charge abetting it?"}, {"title": "Billionaire investor Carl Icahn on SVB collapse: The problem with the system is we issue too much capital", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/media/billionaire-investor-carl-icahn-svb-collapse-problem-system-capital", "tag": "MEDIA", "content": "Billionaire investor Carl Icahn joined \"Your World with Neil Cavuto\" Monday to express his concerns about the state of the U.S. economy and the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and its ramifications.\n\nSILICON VALLEY BANK COLLAPSE: KEVIN MCCARTHY SAYS LARGER BANK ACQUIREMENT MAY BE \u2018BEST OPTION\u2019 TO COOL MARKETS\n\nCARL ICAHN: I think the banking crisis is something that you might expect in Silicon Valley Bank.

Recent years have seen online hustles move from the margins of work to the mainstream.\n\nWhat's more, gigs are no longer about earning that little extra cash. Nearly 60 million American professionals did freelance work of some form last year - an all-time high. Of those U.S. workers doing a side gig, 41% said they rely on the income to make ends meet. That represents a 10% jump from before the pandemic (31% of side hustlers said the same in 2019).\n\nWith a recession likely looming, a sense of general job insecurity is percolating through the workforce. An October survey showed around three-quarters of Americans intend to stay in their current job due to fears over the economic downturn.\n\nPET FISH FEE AT MISSOURI APARTMENT COMPLEX SHOCKS POTENTIAL RENTER; ERROR 'WILL BE CORRECTED SOON'\n\nDespite the uncertainty (or perhaps because of it), workers are out for more. Nearly half of the American workers hope for a raise or promotion this year. Yet even those who get one could be left disappointed.\n\nMost raises did not keep up with inflation last year. On average, total wage adjustments in 2022 remained two percentage points below inflation, according to a survey of CFOs published by Federal Reserve banks in December. This year could see more of the same. On average, CFOs plan to lift pay rates by 3.3% in 2023, yet inflation - currently at 6.5% - may stay north of that figure.\n\nYet income goes far beyond the office these days, and many may turn to moonlight to make up for the missing pay bump. Here we'll look at some of the fastest and easiest money-making hacks, consider some more structured side-gigs, and discuss how to avoid side-hustle burnout and maintain a healthy lifestyle.\n\nQuick N' Easy\n\nIn this digital world of ours, there are many fast-money apps attracting people to them to make a quick $20.\n\nThese simple \"tasking\" hustles involve filling out surveys or even hunting for sign-up bonuses. They require few setup costs and are often easy to fit around your daily schedule. Apps like Survey Junkie, Swagbucks, and InboxDollars all provide a convenient, one-stop platform to start earning.\n\nThese apps can be called hustles or just doing tasks during your free time while at home watching the TV or standing in some place waiting. It requires a few minutes, and you can earn some points that turn into dollars when cashed out.\n\nNot all are digital, though. Some earning hacks involve monetizing house chores, whether it be selling eggs from your backyard chicken coup or walking your neighbor's dog.\n\nNext Level\n\nThose looking for something more substantial and structured consider one of the dozens of side jobs that combine regular income with added flexibility.\n\nSide gigs do not have to involve a brand-new skill you add to your hypothetical utility belt. It can easily be something you already enjoy doing. If you are an accountant, you can work as a virtual bookkeeper. If you are a teacher, you can work as a tutor or online English teacher in your free time.\n\nEven things you didn't know could make money, like managing social media for companies or even pet sitting.\n\nTaking photos is an often overlooked side hustle. If you like taking photos, you can sell them online on Shutterstock or iStock.\n\nSide jobs help you earn that extra cash to make ends meet or to use it to bolster your savings and investments.\n\nAvoiding Burnout\n\nSide hustles and side gigs often have a positive connotation associated with them. Social media is filled with success stories of people using their skills and hobbies to make additional money. Is it always as easy as it looks, though?\n\nAs prices have risen and wages mostly stagnated, working people are finding it challenging to make ends meet. Many are now abandoning their leisure time and instead spending it pursuing additional income to break that paycheck-to-paycheck cycle.\n\nIn the U.S., about 44% of people are working side hustles, and one out of every two people between the age of 25-35 have a side gig. With all this work and no play, people often find themselves with no hobbies or not knowing what to do with their free time. The Financial Independence, Retire Early ( FIRE ) movement came to light because people felt burned out and wanted freedom from working all the time.\n\nYet the pandemic caused a breakthrough. It provided an opportunity to rediscover forgotten hobbies as many home-bound people tried to figure out how to occupy their time - activities like baking, art, and singing became creative outlets again. These hobbies bring a sense of satisfaction and flow absent in most office jobs.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSide hustles, therefore, should not only be about extra income, but rekindling enthusiasm for life outside of traditional work. However, starting and growing a side hustle can take a significant amount of bandwidth, which can be challenging if you already have a full-time job or other obligations.\n\nIt's essential to set clear boundaries and prioritize your time effectively to avoid burnout. There is no guarantee of success, and running a side hustle can also be stressful. Remember, it may take some time and experimentation to find what works. Regardless of what new hustle opportunities 2023 brings, most workers may find it easier to start with something simple that can still provide cash flow to get through the tough economic time ahead.\n\nThis article was produced and syndicated by Wealth of Geeks."}, {"title": "On this day in history, March 12, 1933, FDR gives his first 'fireside chat' radio address", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/this-day-history-march-12-1933-fdr-gives-first-fireside-chat-radio-address", "tag": "LIFESTYLE", "content": "President Franklin D.

Never before in American history has a president released a budget/tax plan that wallops American businesses with a bigger tax bill than this.\n\nThe budget Biden proposes contains roughly $4 trillion in higher taxes over the next decade. He keeps saying that he just wants millionaires and billionaires to \"pay their fair share,\" but this plan isn\u2019t so much a punch in the nose to the wealthy (who already pay 42% of the income taxes) but to the nation\u2019s small business owners and the shareholders of large and successful American companies.\n\nBIDEN\u2019S $7-TRILLION BUDGET GAME TAKES MORE OF YOUR MONEY.

(Remember, most small and medium businesses do not pay corporate taxes, the owners pay the taxes on the company under the personal income tax system.) So how are you going to create more jobs and higher wages when you are sucking more money out of these companies and their employers?\n\nThis plan isn\u2019t just lousy economics, it is unpatriotic.

More than 150 million Americans have stock ownership in these firms directly or indirectly through pensions and 401k plans for their retirement.\n\nHOUSE REPUBLICANS COULD FORCE A VOTE ON BIDEN'S BUDGET: 'EVERY DEMOCRAT WILL BE PUT ON THE RECORD'\n\nThe Biden plan, when you include state taxes, would leave America with one of the highest corporate tax rate in the world. It would also raise the repatriation tax, which is the money stored overseas and brought back to the U.S. We want companies to do that as the money gets reinvested here on these shores, rather than in China or Canada or the Cayman Islands.\n\nIf we are going to tax businesses, shouldn\u2019t we be taxing companies that are located abroad, rather than creating jobs here in America? This plan isn\u2019t just lousy economics, it is unpatriotic. It puts America last.\n\nOn the capital gains tax, Biden wants a higher tax on stock sales than at any time since the 1970s. If you tax something, you get less of it. What this tax increase does is discourage Americans of all income groups from saving and investing and taking risks in placing capital in start-up companies \u2013 that are high risk, but also offer high returns. It\u2019s this seed capital, subject to the capital gains tax, that turns small companies into the next Google.\n\nWhen you combine Biden\u2019s corporate tax with the higher capital gains tax, you are talking about the government helping itself to as much as 60% of a company\u2019s profits in taxes.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nWait, I\u2019m not done \u2013 or, I should say, Biden isn\u2019t done.

ConocoPhillips previously stated that, for the project to remain economic viability, the federal government would need to approve at least three of the sites.\n\nThe Department of Interior (DOI) will publish the final decision on the Willow Project, but President Biden and senior White House officials have been actively involved in overseeing the approval process. Industry groups, Alaska lawmakers and local communities urged the president to approve the project for its economic benefits while activists argued it would have a devastating impact on the environment.\n\n\"This decision on Willow is a huge test for the Biden administration on so many issues that they claim to care about,\" Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, told Fox News Digital in an interview last week. \"Of course it's critically important to Alaska, but it's critically important to America \u2014 a project of this size when we need energy security.\"\n\nBIDEN APPEARS TO GO OFF SCRIPT TO SAY US NEEDS OIL, GAS DRILLING\n\nIn a statement Saturday, the White House noted Biden's \"aggressive climate agenda\" and denied that a decision has been made on Willow.\n\n\"President Biden is delivering on the most aggressive climate agenda of any U.S. president in history and spurring an unprecedented expansion of clean energy,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement to Fox News Digital.\n\n\"The Department of the Interior will make an independent decision on the Willow Project,\" she continued. \"No final decisions have been made \u2014 anyone who says there has been a final decision is wrong.\"\n\nThe expected final record of decision comes years after ConocoPhillips first proposed the project. The company has projected it would produce up to 180,000 barrels of oil per day, create more than 2,500 construction jobs and 300 long-term jobs, and deliver as much as $17 billion in revenue for the federal government, Alaska and local communities, many of which are Indigenous.\n\nConocoPhillips Alaska said last month that the project \u2014 which was originally approved under the Trump administration before a federal judge ordered the government to conduct a more rigorous environmental analysis \u2014 would \"benefit local communities and enhance American energy security.\"\n\nDARK MONEY ECO GROUP APPEARS TO BE ASTROTURFING OPPOSITION TO MAJOR OIL PROJECT\n\nOverall, the project would entail constructing up to 250 wells, multiple pipelines, a central processing plant, an airport and a gravel mine. Opponents of the project said Willow would damage the environment \u2014 as a result of both construction and emissions produced from drilled oil \u2014 and produce a total carbon footprint irreconcilable with the Biden administration's broader climate agenda.\n\n\"The Willow project is a climate disaster waiting to happen that would devastate wildlife, lands, AK communities, and our climate,\" the Sierra Club tweeted Friday. \"We need to speed our transition to clean energy, not double-down on oil and gas.\"\n\nIn addition to environmental groups, climate-focused Democratic lawmakers, have similarly urged Biden against handing a favorable decision to the project, also saying it would increase global emissions and counter progress the administration has made on climate change. It is estimated to produce 278 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions, the equivalent of the carbon footprint of two million cars, over its 30-year lifespan.\n\n\"If this story is right, it's a complete betrayal of Biden's promise not to allow more drilling and a complete catastrophe to rein in climate chaos,\" Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., tweeted following the reports Friday. \"You can't ask other countries to forgo their fossil fuels if we keep greenlighting projects here in America.\"\n\nREPUBLICANS UNVEIL EFFORT TO BOOST ENERGY PRODUCTION, FAST-TRACK PERMITTING PROCESS\n\nRep. Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz., the top Democrat on the Natural Resources Committee, said in February that Willow is the \"exact opposite of what the Biden administration stands for.\"\n\nThe project has also sparked a large opposition campaign on social media, with millions of users calling on Biden to block it.\n\nAs of Friday, two Change.org petitions urging Biden to \"say no\" to the Willow Project had received more than four million signatures. And the hashtag #StopWillow has gone viral on social media, garnering more than 650 million impressions across platforms.\n\nHowever, Sen. Sullivan and his fellow members of the state's congressional delegation \u2014 Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski and Democratic Rep. Mary Peltola \u2014 have aggressively advocated for the Biden administration to approve an economically viable proposal for the project over the last several months. They have argued that it would provide a substantial boost for the state and local communities.\n\nThe delegation met with Biden at the White House for more than an hour on March 2 to reiterate their support for an economically viable approval.\n\nDEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS AIM TO BLOCK BIDEN ADMIN'S ACTION PROTECTING CHINESE SOLAR COMPANIES\n\n\"The Willow Project has been one of my top priorities because it is deeply important to our future as a state,\" Peltola said. \"In the short term, this project will provide thousands of good-paying union jobs and help jump-start Alaska\u2019s economy.\"\n\n\"In the long term, the revenues from Willow will pay for essential state services like public safety and investments in our education system.\"\n\nThe Willow Project has received support from Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy, Alaska Native communities, labor unions, leaders of the North Slope Borough and the Alaska Federation of Natives. The Alaska legislature passed a unanimous bipartisan resolution in support of the project.\n\nOn Feb. 1, DOI subagency Bureau of Land Management (BLM) released its supplemental environmental impact statement for the project. The analysis highlighted the large amount of emissions expected to be produced from the project, but showed that turning to foreign oil imports in lieu of the project's output would result in an even larger carbon footprint.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe BLM ultimately identified a preferred alternative of three drilling sites in the statement, but noted a final decision could defer some of the sites.\n\nThen, in an unusual move, the DOI issued a statement that it had \"substantial concerns about the Willow project and the preferred alternative as presented\" in the environmental analysis shortly after BLM released it."}, {"title": "Federal telework isn\u2019t going away when COVID ends: \u2018Face time is not a proxy for performance\u2019", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/federal-telework-isnt-going-away-covid-ends-face-time-not-proxy-performance", "tag": "DEMOCRATS", "content": "The leader of the Biden administration\u2019s human resources agency this week defended federal workers' extensive use of telework during the pandemic and said COVID proved that federal workers are able to get the job done from their homes.\n\n\"In my opinion, face time is not a proxy for performance,\" Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Director Kiran Ahuja told House lawmakers on Thursday. \"We actually need to utilize these workplace flexibilities in order to take advantage of what we\u2019ve learned throughout the pandemic, that we\u2019ve actually seen greater engagement by employees.

The tax on Social Security is a popular candidate for cutting. Several top Democratic leaders, who would rather target tax cuts to needier Minnesotans, are coming under pressure to compromise.\n\nMinnesota is one of 11 states that tax Social Security income to some degree. But many Minnesota seniors already are fully or partially exempt, and eliminating the taxation could have big costs down the road. Here is a look at the complex issues in the debate:\n\nUS SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS AT RISK IN 10 YEARS DUE TO FUNDING SHORTAGE: MAYA MACGUINEAS\n\nWhy Does Minnesota Tax Social Security?\n\nSocial Security income is already partially exempt at the federal and state levels, and it's fully exempt at the lowest income levels. The idea is that taxpayers with the same incomes should pay the same tax no matter the source of the income. Minnesota's tax code is designed to spare lower-income recipients who are most dependent on the monthly checks, while keeping Social Security taxable for well-off residents who have other sources of income. More than 50% of Minnesota households receiving Social Security pay no state taxes on their benefits.\n\nWho Has to Pay the Tax in Minnesota?\n\nIn general, Minnesota residents with federal adjusted gross incomes above $75,000 pay the highest taxes on Social Security. According to the nonpartisan Minnesota House ResearchDepartment, when non-filers are counted, only about a third of all Social Security benefits paid to Minnesota residents are subject to state income tax. But around 370,000 filers paid at least some state tax on their Social Security in 2019. That worked out to about 62% of all returns from residents that listed Social Security income.\n\nWhy is It So Complicated?\n\nFiguring out how much of one's Social Security income is currently taxable \u2014 or will be in one's future retirement \u2014 isn't simple. Short of sitting down and running your tax calculations, or consulting a professional preparer, taxpayers can get a rough idea for various scenarios from an online tool developed by House Research.\n\nWho pays and how much isn't neat and simple because two different tax policies result in Social Security being exempt. One is a federal exclusion from gross income for a portion of the benefits. The other is a Minnesota-specific subtraction for a portion of Social Security income that's subject to federal tax. They interact with other sources of income, and the effects aren't necessarily clear on returns.\n\n\"It is hard for folks to understand, I think, which of their Social Security is taxable and which is exempt, and I think that probably contributes to folks maybe thinking they are paying more for taxes on their Social Security than they actually do,\" said Nan Madden, director of the Minnesota Budget Project, an initiative of the Minnesota Council of Nonprofits.\n\nWhy Not Just Eliminate the Tax?\n\nComplete elimination was a popular theme for GOP candidates in 2022, and as well as some Democrats in swing districts that were key to Democrats winning the trifecta of the House, Senate and governor's office. The growth in the state's projected budget surplus to an enormous $17.5 billion has only fueled the calls for permanent tax relief.\n\nGOP leaders like to frame elimination as relief for seniors who are struggling with soaring inflation, even if the ones struggling the most are the least likely to be taxed on Social Security. They also say it would make Minnesota more competitive with other states as a place to retire, slowing the migration to the Sunbelt and neighboring states that don't tax Social Security..\n\nMadden and other critics of elimination point out that it would be expensive, costing the state $604 million in lost revenue in fiscal 2024, according to estimates from the Minnesota Department of Revenue, rising to $777 million in 2027, and continuing to increase. That's money that could otherwise go to schools, health care, housing and other services, many of which benefit seniors.\n\nAccording to the Minnesota Budget Project, more than half of the tax savings would go to households with incomes over $143,000 \u2014 the highest 20% \u2014 who would get annual tax savings averaging more than $2,000. Relatively little relief, if any, would go to households with incomes of $60,000 or less \u2014 the bottom 40%.\n\nMINNESOTA REPUBLICANS PROPOSE $13B TAX CUT\n\nWhat Specifics Are on the Table?\n\nDemocratic Gov. Tim Walz has proposed expanding the exemptions without eliminating them altogether, a move that would benefit around 376,000 filers with an average tax cut of $281.

What it means is it could be time to buy gold and stockpile food. Oh, there's a deal on Russian steel case and then go pick up a pallet. Just kidding, sort of.\n\nYesterday, some of the biggest banks in this country, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley collectively lost more than $50 billion in market value in one day. That's quite a hit. On the other hand, those banks still exist, and you can't say that for Silicon Valley Bank . As of this morning, Silicon Valley Bank or SVB has gone under completely. That makes the second-biggest bank failure in the history of this country, and that's significant.\n\nSVB financed nearly half of all venture-backed health care and technology companies in the United States. It also apparently held significant cash reserves for some of the biggest cryptocurrencies, and it's now gone. Federal regulators have renamed it and taken it over and that means an awful lot of people lost an awful lot of money and no, most of that money was not insured, no matter what they tell you. The FDIC only guarantees bank deposits up to $250,000, and according to some reports, more than 90% of all deposits at SBP exceeded that and it's unclear whether those people will ever see their money again.\n\nIn fact, when customers showed up at SVB's branch in Manhattan today to get their deposits back. Managers called the police. So, what we have here is a 1929 style bank run and that's not a good sign for anyone. The question is whether the people who run SVB saw it coming. The CEO, a man called Greg Becker, apparently sold more than $2 million in bank stock over the last two weeks. According to the site, \"Unusual Whales,\" several other high-level employees of SVB, including Chief Marketing Officer Michelle Draper, Chief Operations Officer Phil Cox, General Counsel Michael Zuckert, all sold significant amounts of stock in SVB this year. Did those employees know their bank was in trouble? We don't know and once again, where were the regulators? They\u2019re supposed to prevent this.\n\nMEDIA OUTLETS BURY FTX-DEMOCRAT CAMPAIGN FINANCING ANGLE\n\nOnce again, we don't know and the business press is supposed to be telling ordinary people what's happening with business. Apparently, nobody noticed anything. In fact, as with the FTX crypto scam, you may recall, self-described financial experts in the media were busy promoting Silicon Valley Bank as a great investment that would last forever. The formerly great, but now quite embarrassing Forbes Magazine, in fact, named SVB to its list of America's best banks, not once, but five years in a row. And of course, inevitably you saw this coming, here is professional B.S. artist/dumb person Jim Cramer of CNBC telling his viewers to buy Silicon Valley Bank even though it was in the process of going under. This is last month;\n\nJIM CRAMER: SVB Financial, this company is a merchant bank with a deposit base that Wall Street had been mistakenly concerned about. SVB is the old Silicon Valley Bank, recently bought one of our favorite research firms Moffett Nathanson and it's become less dependent on private equity and venture capitalist offerings. Wait a second, those dried up last year, they could come back! Long-term private equity and venture capital, they're not going away, being a banker to these immense pools of capital has always been a very good business. SVB's nearly 40% rally this year is barely a drop in the bucket\n\nSVB is great. If that guy ever endorses anything you're doing, move to the Canary Islands. Change your name because disaster is coming, but just like FTX, all the geniuses told you to buy SVB, even when it was on the brink of total collapse. What explains that? Surely something does. We don't really know at this point. Hopefully we will someday.\n\nWhat we can say tonight is that SVB, like the scammers at FTX, had quite the public relations department. We're not some greedy finance outfit that exists solely to generate cash for overpaid sleaze balls who run it. No, that's not us. We may be a bank. We've got the soul of an NGO. We care. We're saving the world and to prove it, there's a whole page on SVB's website about their plans to \"monitor and reduce our own carbon emissions.\" Yes, because you want a bank that cares about carbon emissions and of course, there's endless posturing because it's all free about diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\nMarisa Phan, the managing director at SVB, wrote this on LinkedIn just three weeks before the bank collapse \"Feeling inspired and energized after hosting an extraordinary group of pioneering and dynamic women in Silicon Valley Bank's Female Founder and VC Tahoe Ski Retreat.\" Adjectives are free. They use a bunch of them and then she attached pictures of the ski trip showing the group of these pioneering and dynamic female bankers having a great time because, of course, they're having a great time because few things are more empowering to oppressed female bankers than skiing in Tahoe.\n\nCHICAGO BANK SECURITY GUARD SHOT BY ROBBER, POLICE SAY\n\nAnd they kept this cr-- up to the very end. As their bank began to slip beneath the waves, SVB posted this on its social media feeds \"As part of Women's History Month, we're celebrating founders of women led companies like Suma Wealth's, Beatriz Acevedo, a company that SVB described lovingly as \"focused on closing the Latinx wealth gap.\" It's the problem with Latinx. There's a wealth gap and there was a video, too. Of course, there was.\n\nSo, now that SVB has blown up and lost billions of other people's money in the process, we thought we would show you the video because, oh, we can't resist. Enjoy.\n\nBEATRIZ ACEVEDO: My name is Beatriz Acevedo and I am the CEO and co-founder of Suma Wealth. I was born in Tijuana, Mexico. I am a very proud border girl who had the privilege to grow up with the best of both worlds. I went to school in San Diego. I went to UCSD. I have a lot of scars from my days going across the border. I remember I got this memo and it just said that all my shows were cancelled, and it was a time where women, never men, were put into something they called their refrigerator. If they felt like you had a lot of power, they would just put you there to cool you off for a while.\n\nUnaddressed in the video is whether she's actually a capable banker. We hope so. We have no idea. We know the guys at SVB were not capable bankers, didn't seem to spend a lot of time banking or paying close attention because they had videos to make about dynamic, pioneering, glass ceiling shattering women. So, when interest rates were at historic lows, SVB bought more than 20 billion in long-term Treasury bonds and to be fair, they were encouraged by the government to do this. All banks were.\n\nThe problem was when interest rates went up as they were always going to, because they can't stay at zero forever (Did you know that?). Well, when that happened, those bonds lost their value and that, of course, was a disaster for a ton of banks, but a true disaster for SVB and then a disaster for a lot of individuals who had their money there and companies that had borrowed money from SVB.\n\nHOUSE FREEDOM CAUCUS MEMBERS UNVEIL PLAN TO ADDRESS DEBT CEILING CRISIS AMID BATTLE WITH BIDEN, DEMOCRATS\n\nSo, you can expect a lot of bankruptcies in the coming weeks due to this and then the countless downstream effects from those bankruptcies, all of them bad. This is a disaster, not just for the tech industry, people who we could easily make fun of, but for everyone, for all of us.\n\nBut the interesting thing is the Biden administration doesn't seem to care at all. They're not that interested because numbers, whether you're making money or losing money or doing something efficiently, you're doing it sloppily doesn't really matter as long as you're making videos about pioneering female bankers and as long as they get to ski in Tahoe. That's the real concern.\n\nJust today, Biden's top economic adviser, Cecilia Rouse, addressed reporters in the White House in the briefing room about what had just happened and she assured everybody that the bank run we're watching is an isolated incident. No, it's not a big deal, just this one bank. It's not connected to anything else at all and the fact that this bank failed, just like the fact that FTX failed, has nothing to do with the fact that the people who run it spend a ton of their time doing completely irrelevant cr-- that had to do with politics and changing American culture.\n\nWere you reassured by that? We should know that Cecilia Rouse has been thinking a lot about this when she worked at Princeton, which is a university in New Jersey. She wrote her research agenda on diversity, equity and inclusion. The title is \"Diversity in the Economics Profession: A New Attack on an Old Problem.\" Because the color of your economists is essential. Their competence? Not so much. Just so you know, by the way, these are the consequences of that attitude. See in South Africa, where they don't have electricity tonight.\n\nCoincidentally or not, that is the very same topic, diversity in economics, that our director of our National Economic Council, Lael Brainard, is also fixated on. Another genius! When Brainard was at the Fed in 2021, she wasn't too concerned about future bank collapses due to the insane and reckless Fed policy she was overseeing. No, why worry about that because there's climate change? That's what she was really worried about, climate change. \"As part of our prudential and financial stability responsibilities, we are developing scenario analysis to model the possible financial risks associated with climate change and assess the resilience of individual financial institutions in the financial system to those risks.\"\n\nYELLEN ANSWERS WHETHER IRS WILL CONSIDER RACE, GENDER IN AUDITS AS PART OF BIDEN 'EQUITY' PUSH\n\nJust a pause for one second. Anyone who writes that way is a moron m-o-e-r-o-n, moron. So, if you find someone in a position of authority, particularly economics, who cannot write a declarative sentence, be prepared for your banks to fail .\n\nWe should be honest that ESG and equity are only part of the problem here. Stupidity is a huge part of the problem, SVB and FTX for that matter are just two of several major players in the financial industry that have gone under in recent months. Are you noticing any of this?\n\nThere was the bank Silvergate (more than 11 billion in assets). There was a crypto broker, Voyager (a billion in assets), the crypto fund 3AC ($10 billion in assets), Block-fi and a number of others. On Friday, Wells Fargo customers reported they didn't get their paychecks as expected. The bank says that was just a computer glitch. We don't really know, but we're paying attention.\n\nWhat is very clear is that we're witnessing something serious happening in the finance sector and in other sectors of our economy. We don't know where any of this is going. We're certainly praying for the best. We don't want to see hysteria. But if you're the Treasury secretary of the United States, you would be very concerned. You'd be paying really close attention because that's your job.\n\nBut Janet Yellen is not paying close attention. She's not worried about it because it's in this country. She's worried instead about funding the pensions of Ukrainian government workers. She flew to Kyiv the other day to tell us that and as always, Janet Yellen is highly focused on her core duties as treasury secretary. That would be equity, climate change and abortion.\n\nJANET YELLEN: The Biden-Harris administration has made racial equity a centerpiece of our economic agenda.\n\nYELLEN: Roe v. Wade and access to reproductive health care, including abortion, helped lead to increased labor force participation.\n\nYELLEN: President Biden, and I feel the same way too, believe that climate change is an existential threat that absolutely must be addressed.\n\nYELLEN: The message I bring you from President Biden is simple. America will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes.\n\nShe's very upset about Ukraine and we don't have enough abortions and equity, equity, abortion and Ukraine. Got it. Got it. Got it. Children hour is over. It's time for the adults because we have actual problems, not even call them systemic problems with our economy and so when you have those, you want smart, wise people with foresight and self-control and the ability to focus on things of actual consequence, not on the fashionable cr-- that occupies most of our time here on cable news, but in the long-term stuff that will ensure your country remains strong and prosperous when you are gone, which for most of these people won't be long because they're very, very old.\n\nMCCARTHY SHREDS BIDEN'S BUDGET PROPOSAL: 'COMPLETELY UNSERIOUS'\n\nWhere are those people? Where are the adults? Here you have the second biggest bank failure in American history, the biggest since 2008, the second largest failure in our nation's history and they're yammering on about racial equity. Really?

If you don\u2019t pay close attention to the details, you\u2019ll wind up suckered by the man moving the ball around. President Joe Biden\u2019s political talking points may appease his Democrat colleagues, but the details should alarm Americans who stand to lose in this $7-trillion shell game on the national stage.\n\nThe first attempt at distraction in this game is the assumption that the Treasury needs more tax revenue to reduce the deficit. At first glance, that checks out mathematically \u2013 but it ignores the larger reality.\n\nFundamentally, the nation does not have a revenue problem; it has a spending problem. Tax revenue has never been higher, whether measured in nominal terms, or adjusted for inflation, or as a percent of GDP, or as a percent of income. Rather, it is government spending which has ballooned to unsustainable levels and created record-breaking deficits.\n\nMCCARTHY SHREDS BIDEN'S BUDGET PROPOSAL: 'COMPLETELY UNSERIOUS'\n\nConsider that federal expenditures were about $4.8 trillion in 2019 but were over $6 trillion in 2022. That\u2019s a 25%-increase in three years \u2014 far outpacing economic growth \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t even include the $6.7 trillion spent during the pandemic in 2020 or the record-breaking $7.2 trillion spent in 2021, Biden\u2019s first year in office.\n\nThe logical choice would be to cut spending, but the White House has opted for more taxes instead. However, many of the proposed tax increases won\u2019t even be paid by those allegedly being taxed. The corporate tax increase is a prime example of another act of deception in this shell game.\n\nCorporations do not pay taxes; only people can pay taxes. The corporate income tax is paid by employees in the form of lower wages, by customers in the form of higher prices, and by savers in the form of lower returns on their investments.\n\nThe White House touts this as \"making corporations pay their fair share,\" but that is a sound bite which isn\u2019t very sound. The middle-class employee at a corporation, who is also a customer at corporations, and who has a 401(k) invested in corporations, is unknowingly paying the very taxes which Biden alleged would fall on \"big business.\"\n\nLikewise, tax increases on coal, oil and natural gas will simply be passed onto consumers, both in the form of higher utility bills but also higher prices just about everywhere. When businesses are paying more for their own utilities and for transportation, they end up raising the prices they charge for their own goods and services.\n\nA similar illusion is at work in the White House\u2019s proposal to effectively double the tax on capital gains. Inflation has driven up the price of many investments, but there has not been a commensurate increase in the real value of those assets. Nevertheless, capital gains tax is due on these inflated price increases, at twice the current rate.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nOn top of inflation already being a tax, the White House wants to increase that burden on savers even further in this budget, so that inflation gets you coming and going. That doesn\u2019t sound like \"paying your fair share,\" as the president says.\n\nAll told, the proposed budget adds $5.5 trillion in additional taxes over the next decade. And where is all this tax revenue going?\n\nInstead of addressing the structural problems in Medicare, Obamacare, Social Security and the Highway Trust Fund, this budget kicks the can down the road, merely putting off the day of reckoning a little longer by throwing more money at the problem. Ironically, research shows that this budget\u2019s higher taxes will undermine the very economic growth that is necessary to keep these government programs adequately funded.\n\nThe logical choice would be to cut spending, but the White House has opted for more taxes instead.

The measure also provides other rental protections, including requiring that evictions be for cause such as not paying rent.\n\n\"This is a monumental act for the City of Boston,\" said City Councilor Ricardo Arroyo, who supported the proposal. \"I commend the mayor for moving forward with a rent stabilization plan to address what has been and is an ongoing, long-standing issue of price gouging and rent gouging and displacement of residents of the City of Boston.\"\n\nWASHINGTON PROPERTY OWNER SAYS SQUATTERS RETURNED AFTER SWAT RAID: 'I'M GOING TO GIVE UP'\n\nSeveral council members said they were moved by earlier testimony from tenants who were facing rent increases upwards of 100% in some neighborhoods.

Typical rents in Boston have gone up over the past year by 8.1%.\n\n\"Boston is increasingly out of reach for a majority of our seniors, immigrant populations, families and individuals,\" City Councilor Gabriela Coletta said, adding that rents have increased 227% since 2011 in east Boston, which is part of her district. \"Bad actors who take advantage of a bullish rental market can and do price-gouge in a way that is displacing hard-working individuals who just want to be able to live in this city and contribute to the local economy.\"\n\nThe proposal would also exempt owner-occupied properties with six units or fewer \u2014 including the three-family homes that dot the city\u2019s neighborhoods. Also exempt would be any new apartment buildings built during the first 15 years after being issued a certificate of occupancy.\n\nModeled after measures in California and Oregon, the push for rent control in Boston is part of a growing trend nationwide.

According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, the average woman in America will live to age 81. Conversely, the average American man will live to only 76.\n\nThere's been much discussion over the years surrounding womanhood in the modern age, and at which age women are considered to be \"past their prime.\"\n\nWOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH: THE 2023 THEME, WHY WE CELEBRATE AND EVERYTHING ELSE YOU NEED TO KNOW\n\nIn a recent CNBC article, for instance, the author alleged women hit their peak earning years in their 40s. According to PayScale data cited by the article, as women reach their late 30s and early 40s, their wages start to flatline. Contrarily, men will continue to see their salaries grow, as most don't hit their respective peaks until the age of 55.\n\nThe debate underscoring this discrepancy was heightened last month when CNN's Don Lemon made on-air comments that even his own network dubbed \"sexist.\" When discussing 51-year-old Nikki Haley's 2024 GOP presidential bid, he outraged viewers and colleagues when he described her as being no longer \"in her prime.\"\n\nLemon doubled down, subsequently arguing a woman is only \"considered to be in their prime in [their] 20s and 30s and maybe 40s,\" according to Google. Lemon ultimately apologized and took an extended vacation before returning to the air the following week.\n\nThe comments drove media headlines for a week, but they also served to further the discussion surrounding men's perception of women's value in the workplace.\n\nCNN INSIDERS SAY DON LEMON HAS 'NO DEFENDERS' AT THE NETWORK, NOT WORTH THE HEADACHE TO KEEP ON-AIR\n\nIn recognition of International Women's Day, Fox News Digital spoke with women classified as middle-aged and even elderly, who've defied stereotypes and made and continue to make major strides in their industries.\n\nMarlene Wallach, 68, is the former president and owner of the Wilhelmina Kids & Teens modeling and talent agency, past clients of which include actresses Natalie Portman, Katherine Heigl and Amanda Seyfried.\n\nIn 1998, after a seven-year stint producing small films in Los Angeles, the Bayside, Queens native returned to New York City and purchased the kids' agency and talent arm from Wilhelmina Models, widely regarded as one of the top agencies in the world.\n\nBut from her first discussion with the then-owner, a man, Wallach felt like she was on a different playing field.\n\nMODEL SEARCH CONTESTANTS PROVE 40 IS THE NEW 20\n\nWallach, who had attended the business meeting with her then-boyfriend and \"advisor of sorts,\" told Fox News Digital she was initially left out of her own conversation.\n\n\"I went in there with an idea of taking over the kids and teen division and starting a talent arm in the company\u2026 [The then-owner] was sitting on one side of the desk and the two of us [Wallach and her then-boyfriend] were sitting on the other, and he was talking to [my boyfriend]. It was as if I wasn't there.\"\n\n\"I just stood up and said, 'I'm the one with the money. Talk to me!'\" Wallach recounted.\n\nWallach said it was her enthusiasm that made the then-owner immediately flip the switch and show her respect.\n\n\"He looked at me and he said, 'I like you. Let's do a deal.' And really, he was my biggest supporter and invited me to do other deals,\" Wallach said.\n\nProving that primetime for working women can come later in life, at 65 years old, Wallach founded her own company: Gleem Beauty.\n\nWith over 32,000 Instagram followers to date, the organic aloe vera skincare product line will see its QVC debut on May 16. It's an offshoot of sorts for Wallach, having managed models for decades and encountered \"skin issues\" her whole career at Wilhelmina.\n\n\"I am told that I have my enthusiasm is infectious. And if you want to call that aggression, we'll call it aggression. But I don't care what you call it. Like they say, \u2018call me for dinner.\u2019\" - Marlene Wallach\n\nSURVEY FINDS MEN ARE MORE EMOTIONAL THAN WOMEN AT WORK\n\nWhile a recent survey suggested men are actually more emotional than women at work, stereotypes regarding a woman's proclivity towards being the more emotional gender persist.\n\nSo how does someone like Wallach reconcile this? For her, the answer is simple.\n\n\"For me, it's not aggressiveness. It's enthusiasm,\" Wallach told Fox News Digital. \"And I am told that my enthusiasm is infectious. And if you want to call that aggression, we'll call it aggression. But I don't care what you call it. Just, like they say, call me for dinner.\"\n\nMarlene Wallach isn't the only successful woman to have started a company during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn response to a pandemic-induced increase in at-home alcoholic consumption, 45-year-old Jen Morales recently co-created Mixicles, a line of botanically infused ice cubes for both cocktail and mocktail creation.\n\nSMALL BUSINESS IS BOOMING. HERE ARE 6 WAYS FOR ENTREPRENEURS TO KEEP THRIVING\n\nMorales, a native of Puerto Rico, told Fox News Digital that it hasn't always been easy walking that aforementioned thin line \u2013 whether it's been in the courtroom, or in business \u2013 and that it's up to women to widen the line for other women.\n\n\"I think that the solution here, or at least a solution here, is to better mentor other women. There's this sense sometimes when there are not a lot of women in leadership in a particular organization or company that there's this one seat at the table. And so that particular woman will, for whatever reason, appear to be threatened by younger talent that's coming up the ranks,\" Morales told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"You can see this play out in a couple of ways, and one of them is the sort of pull-the-ladder-up behind you thing,\" she said. \"And so that's their way of sort of keeping this sense of like, 'I'm the one here. I hold the power and I'm not going to let anybody else in.' And I have to say, I'm not excusing those women, but I can also see where if you buy into this mentality of like, 'Well, there's only room for one of us at the top because there isn't anybody else around,' that's part of the problem, too. It's systemic.\"\n\n\"The solution here...is [for women] to better mentor other women.\" - Jen Morales\n\nMorales went on to address Lemon's comments, arguing the CNN host \"said the quiet part out loud\" and explaining that remarks like his help further men's perception that women can easily \"be dismissed.\"\n\nAnd not just women, or women of a certain age \u2013 but, as Morales pointedly remarked, women of a certain race.\n\n\"You hear it mostly, too, with African-American women. Oh, the angry black woman. They're just expressing a view that you don't like, right? So you're going to marginalize that voice by just being like, \u2018oh, whatever.\u2019 Or, 'I've figured out she's PMS eating or menopausal,' or whatever the things they think,\" Morales said. \"It's just a way to be really dismissive. And then it's very inherently sexist or racist.\"\n\nMorales echoed the aforementioned survey's findings, arguing that, in her experience, it's been men who've historically taken on the more negative traits commonly associated with women.\n\n\"I actually found that, in general, men have been more easily threatened and thrown off balance emotionally than a lot of the women I worked with. And they kind of gossip more behind people's backs and have\u2026 much more fragile egos to protect.\"\n\nMorales told Fox News Digital it's why she believes she's been told to \"keep her head down\" by both men and women alike. She went on to assert that, in order to address and ultimately fix the problem, women must better understand the plights of everyone involved.\n\nIt's all part of creating a united society that isn't so quick to dismiss others, Morales maintained, in an effort to achieve true equality.\n\nThat path to equality is one that Gayle Keller, 44 - author, motivational speaker, and former Microsoft sales executive - is working tirelessly to help pave.\n\n\"I saw the path to parity. That gap [between men and women] still exists,\" Keller told Fox News Digital. \"And I thought, \u2018what can I do to help pave the way?\u2019 I'm not going to close it on my own, but it's my duty to help other women out.\"\n\nKeller, whose new book Full S.T.E.A.M Ahead illuminates common issues women face in the workplace - such as lack of confidence, competition from colleagues, workplace bullying, sexual harassment, and mental health issues - described wanting to create a singular camp of industry women. While many might be familiar with the acronym S.T.E.M. (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics), the new inclusion of the letter \"A\" is meant to appeal to young women looking to join the Arts.\n\nBecause, as Keller noted, closing the gender gap starts with women closing the gap between themselves and other women first.\n\n\"We're [women are] counting ourselves out.\" - Gayle Keller\n\nKeller cited a recent LinkedIn post from The Washington Post, which served to provide insight into the very gap Keller has made it her mission to fight:\n\n\"There's a job posting and a woman looks at it, and she maybe has 70% of the skill sets that the qualification requires of the job,\" Keller paraphrased. \"'I only have 70%. I'm not applying. I'm not worthy enough. Doesn't apply.' Hmm. But a man reads it and goes, 'I only have 70%. I'm going to learn the other thing when I get that job and I'm applying.' So we're counting ourselves out,\" she said.\n\nWOMEN ENTREPRENEURS HAVE IT BEST IN THESE METRO AREAS: REPORT\n\nKeller went on to stress the need for women to be more honest about their experiences, even and especially the negative ones.\n\n\"We never see the steps of the fear and the steps back; it's two steps back to take one step forward. But we don't see them. And if we could be more authentic in our journeys and share those stories, it'll just help other people. Because, yes, some men uplift women; but women need to uplift women.\"\n\nKeller explained the five-pillar system on which her book is predicated: courage, decisiveness, clarity, competence, and balance, telling Fox News Digital she hopes to instill these values in women of all ages.\n\nWhen asked to comment on whether she believes women are ever \"past their prime,\" Keller stressed that it's women's age and experience that breeds the very wisdom necessary to make them effective leaders.\n\n\"To me, everything comes down to experience\u2026 I'm a Chief Reinvention Officer. Reinvention has no age limitations. And the people that I work with are 30-plus-plus, because, to me, you need to have [the] experience to understand what you like, what you don't like, what you want and what you don't want in life, your job, career, and how you give back to the community. That experience is so important,\" Keller told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"You talk to women that are 50-plus and they say, \u2018you know, when you hit your fifties, you become invisible to society.\u2019 But you're still you, and you feel like you're at your best in your life.\"\n\n\"And so that's why I want to do the work I do to hit all those different age ranges. Because it's so important to educate people at a young age that life isn't over after you have kids, where men sort of get a break there,\" she argued.\n\nKeller, too, commented on Lemon's remarks, saying there's a systemic issue at play.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAll three women argue it begins with righting our social system \u2014 and Wallach, Morales, and Keller suggest that starts with women."}, {"title": "Kevin McCarthy intends to restore order to GOP House following 2022 Midterm elections", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kevin-mccarthy-intends-to-restore-order-to-gop-house-following-2022-midterm-elections", "tag": "KEVIN MCCARTHY", "content": "Not long ago, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., was courting Reps. Andrew Clyde, R-Ga., Byron Donalds, R-Fla., and Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., in the multi-day speaker\u2019s election. The California Republican finally flipped those lawmakers and prevailed on the 15th ballot to be elected House speaker.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear who McCarthy may try to court next. But what McCarthy might pursue is normalcy in the House so Republicans can govern in their new majority. The looming clash over the debt ceiling may award McCarthy an opportunity to find accord in politics. Even with President Biden.\n\nThe duo will have to get together in some form on the debt ceiling sooner or later. But it\u2019s unclear if McCarthy may try to use this juncture to govern.\n\nThe president and the speaker had one in-person meeting a few weeks ago. That didn\u2019t really count as negotiating \u2014 yet. It\u2019s best described as they were \"talking about something\" in respect to the debt ceiling \u2014 even though Biden said he wouldn\u2019t negotiate.\n\nMcCarthy could seek a compromise on some sort of spending package. But it\u2019s unclear how this is going to turn out. McCarthy clasped the speaker\u2019s gavel in the wee hours of Saturday morning, January 7. It was the wildest speaker\u2019s election since 1859. McCarthy is now forced to govern. The right may abhor the policies of President Biden and Democrats, but the president and congressional Democrats ran the table in 2021 \u2013 advancing nearly every component of their legislative agenda. Sometimes they even did it on a bipartisan basis.\n\nJUDGE DENIES JAN. 6 DEFENDANT'S TRIAL DELAY SOUGHT AFTER MCCARTHY'S RELEASE OF CAPITOL RIOT FOOTAGE: REPORT\n\nThere was the $2 trillion COVID bill Democrats approved in March 2021 on their own. There was the bipartisan infrastructure bill. A bipartisan measure to produce computer chips and fight back against China. There were no government shutdowns. Lawmakers approved a bipartisan measure to assist veterans exposed to toxic burn pits. The sides even crafted a modest agreement to expand some background checks and increase access to mental health after a spate of mass shootings.\n\nIt's far from clear what President Biden and McCarthy can ever conjure up when it comes to the debt limit, not to mention the goal of averting a government shutdown this fall. But a nearly ebullient McCarthy departed the White House conclave with a measured skip in his step.\n\n\"There's no agreement. But I left this meeting with a better perspective than I had walking into the meeting,\" said McCarthy. \"I felt as though we were honest with one another. There are times where we were far apart. But we're not.\"\n\nThat doesn\u2019t sound like the customary fire and brimstone rhetoric which rains down from many House Republicans these days.\n\nOVERSIGHT REPUBLICANS TO HOLD EIGHT HEARINGS ON BIDEN ADMIN IN THREE DAYS: \u2018ACCOUNTABILITY IS COMING\u2019\n\nMcCarthy could try to set a tone for governing. Especially ahead of a few topsy-turvy months concerning the debt ceiling. No one\u2019s rattled yet. All it could take is a market shock to spark panic. The Treasury Department says the U.S. will hit the debt ceiling in early June. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) predicts the date falls later in the summer. No one truly knows. But that\u2019s why some wonder about courting calm.\n\n\"I would feel better if I (were) the markets based on the meeting I had today (with the President),\" said McCarthy after the White House session.\n\nNot all House Republicans crave political tranquility. The GOP base \u2014 and certainly those aligned with former President Trump \u2014 regularly sow chaos. Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., recently tangled with Rep. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., at the first meeting of the House Natural Resources Committee over a proposal to bar lawmakers from bringing firearms into the panel\u2019s hearing room.Boebert then charged that Huffman was \"wasting time on political stunts.\"\n\nDuring a debate on the House floor, Boebert lampooned the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.\n\n\"In western Colorado, we call that a fun weekend,\" quipped Boebert of the ATF.\n\nMcCarthy went out of his way to embrace Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and restore her committee assignments after Democrats bounced Greene from panels in 2021. However, McCarthy found himself shushing Greene when she hectored President Biden during his State of the Union address last month. Greene was again in the spotlight when she called for \"a national divorce\" and asked for red and blue states to separate.\n\nWHITE HOUSE BLASTS MCCARTHY-LEAD GOP BORDER TRIP AS \u2018PUBLICITY STUNT WEEKS AFTER BIDEN DEFENDED HIS OWN VISIT\n\nAt her first hearing before the House Oversight Committee, Greene argued that the U.S. Capitol Police (USCP) violated the \"civil rights\" of rioters when they laid siege to the Capitol two years ago. Greene also took up the cause of Ashli Babbitt who U.S. Capitol Police Officer Michael Byrd shot and killed when she tried to break into the Speaker\u2019s Lobby just off the House floor in the middle of the Jan. 6 riot.\n\nThe U.S. Capitol Police and Washington, D.C. prosecutors cleared Byrd. The USCP\u2019s Office of Professional Responsibility says Byrd acted properly since he was authorized to use lethal force \"when the officer reasonably believes that action is in the defense of human life including the officer\u2019s own life or in the defense of any person in immediate danger of serious physical injury.\"\n\nGreene\u2019s position forced McCarthy to wade back into the Jan. 6 milieu.\n\n\"I think the police officer did his job,\" answered McCarthy when asked by reporters if he agreed with Greene\u2019s suggestion that Byrd murdered Babbitt.\n\nWe haven\u2019t even mentioned the headaches posed for House Republicans by Rep. George Santos, R-N.Y., and his long list of lies, fabrications and fables. Boebert, Greene, Santos and a few other controversial House Republicans generate most of the press coverage on Capitol Hill these days. The gripping, contentious election for speaker set the tone for what the public expects from the GOP majority. That\u2019s augmented by anything that is outlandish, provocative or fiery from brash voices in the Republican Conference.\n\nRepublicans try to mitigate turmoil with oversight hearings and discussion about policies which the public cares about. The border. Fentanyl. China. Inflation. The cost of eggs. Crime. But it\u2019s far from clear that those efforts resonate more with the public than the customary Republican invective.\n\nMCCARTHY SAYS GOVERNMENT MUST BUTT OUT OF KIDS' EDUCATION, PUSHES FEDERAL \u2018PARENTS BILL OF RIGHTS\u2019\n\nThat\u2019s why some may hope for a modicum of congressional serenity. Polling data after the 2022 midterm elections suggested that voters rejected chaos fueled by candidates aligned with former President Trump. That\u2019s one reason Republicans failed to capture the Senate and partly why the GOP made only minimal gains in the House. Some handicappers expected the party to flip up to 50 seats.\n\nSo as McCarthy enters his second month in the Speakership, he faces a challenge of governing. President Biden\u2019s poll numbers are weak. A Fox News poll found that only 36% of all voters embraced the way Biden handled the economy. A mere 31% supported his approach to inflation. The President\u2019s overall job performance rating clocked in at 44%. That\u2019s down three points from January of last year. It marked a full 10 point decline for the president since April 2021.\n\nNothing great there. But perception of the GOP\u2019s most-extreme ideologies don\u2019t help Republicans with middle-of-the-road voters who are exhausted by mayhem. Unfortunately for the GOP, bedlam could be on full display this summer and fall if there is a brawl over raising the debt ceiling or a potential government shutdown.\n\nThe midterms revealed that voters desire order.

It sets the stage for a potential first veto by President Joe Biden.\n\nCritics say ESG investments allocate money based on political agendas, such as a drive against climate change, rather than on earning the best returns for savers. They say ESG is just the latest example of the world trying to get \"woke.\"\n\nSENATE KILLS BIDEN ESG INVESTMENT RULE IN STUNNING REBUKE\n\nThe ESG industry, meanwhile, says it helps highlight companies that may be riskier than traditional investing guidelines alone might suggest. That could lead to more stable, safer returns for savers. It also says using an ESG lens could help investors find better, more profitable opportunities.\n\nESG has become popular across a wide range of investors, from smaller-pocketed regular people to pension funds responsible for the retirements of millions of workers.\n\nWhat is ESG?\n\nIt\u2019s an acronym, with each of the letters describing an additional lens that some investors use to decide whether a particular stock or bond looks like a good buy.\n\nBefore risking their money, all investors including both traditional and ESG ones look at how much revenue a company is bringing in, how much profit it\u2019s making and what the prospects are for the future.\n\nESG investors then layer on a few more specific considerations.\n\nWhat is E?\n\nEnvironment. It can pay to avoid companies with poor records on the environment, the thinking goes, because they may be at greater risk of big fines from regulators. Or their businesses could be at particular risk of getting upended by future government attempts to protect the environment.\n\nSuch risks may not be as appreciated by those using just traditional investment analysis, which could lead to too-high stock prices, ESG advocates say. That in turn would mean too-high risk.\n\nOn the flip side, measuring a company\u2019s environmental awareness could also unearth companies that could be better positioned for the future. Companies that care about climate change may be better prepared for its repercussions, whether that means potential flooding damage at factory sites or the risks of increased wildfires.\n\nWhat is S?\n\nSocial. This is a wide-ranging category that focuses on a company\u2019s relationships with people, both within it and outside.\n\nInvestors measuring a company\u2019s social impact often look at whether pay is fair and working conditions are good through the rank and file, for example, because that can lead to better retention of employees, lower turnover costs and ultimately better profits.\n\nOthers consider a company\u2019s record on data protection and privacy, where lax protocols could lead to leaks that drive customers away.\n\nIncreasingly, companies are also getting called upon to take positions on big social issues, such as abortion or the Black Lives Matter movement. Some ESG investors encourage this, saying companies\u2019 employees and customers want to hear it.\n\nNot every ESG investor considers all these factors, but they all get lumped in together under the \"S\" umbrella.\n\nWhat is G?\n\nGovernance, which essentially means the company is running itself well.\n\nThat includes tying executives\u2019 pay to the company\u2019s performance, whether that\u2019s defined by the stock price, profits or something else, and having strong, independent directors on the board to act as a powerful check on CEOs.\n\nHow Big of a Deal is ESG?\n\nInvestors who use one or more ESG criteria or push companies on such issues as a group controlled $8.4 trillion in U.S.-domiciled assets in 2022. That's according to the most recent count by US SIF, a trade group representing the sustainable and responsible investing industry.\n\nThat's enough money to buy Tesla, one of the most valuable U.S. stocks, more than 11 times over. It also means ESG accounted for $1 of every $8 in all U.S. assets under professional management.\n\nWith stock and bond markets tumbling last year, the flow of dollars into ESG funds has slowed since setting a peak in early 2021. U.S. sustainable funds pulled in a net $3 billion over the course of 2022, according to Morningstar.\n\nNot only have sharp drops for all kinds of investment prices raised worries, so has the increased political backlash. During the final three months of 2022, which was a particularly tough period for financial markets, investors pulled nearly $6.2 billion more out of sustainable funds than they put in, according to Morningstar.\n\nStill, despite the slowdown, demand is still higher for sustainable funds than for their traditional peers.\n\nIs It Just Millennials Doing It?\n\nNo, the vast majority of money in ESG investments comes from huge investors like pension funds, insurance companies, endowments at universities and foundations and other big institutional investors.\n\nWhat Impact is It Having?\n\nESG investors are pushing for more engagement with companies, discussing their concerns about the environment, social issues and governance. They\u2019re also casting their votes at annual shareholder meetings with ESG issues more in mind.\n\nIn 2021 a relatively small fund known as Engine No. 1 shocked corporate America after it convinced some of Wall Street\u2019s biggest investment firms to approve its proposal to replace three directors on Exxon Mobil\u2019s board, citing a decarbonizing world.\n\nInvestors are also pushing executives across corporate America to give more details about their carbon emissions, measurements about their impacts on human rights and audits for racial equity.\n\nIt\u2019s all an evolution from the industry\u2019s early days, when \"socially responsible\" investing was quite simplistic. Early funds would just promise not to own stocks of tobacco companies, gun makers, or other companies seen as distasteful.\n\nOVER 100 GROUPS BACK MANCHIN, GOP PLAN TO BLOCK BIDEN\u2019S \u2018WOKE\u2019 ESG INVESTING RULE\n\nAnd the Backlash?\n\nSome politicians have denounced ESG as a politicization of investing.\n\nSome in the business world also have been particularly critical of rating agencies that try to boil complex issues down to simple ESG scores.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk last year called ESG a scam that \"has been weaponized by phony social justice warriors,\" for example. His criticism came shortly after Tesla got kicked out of the S&P 500 ESG index.\n\nThe index tries to hold only companies with better ESG scores within each industry, while holding similar amounts of energy stocks, tech stocks and other sectors as the broader S&P 500 index. That means Exxon Mobil could remain in the S&P 500 ESG index, even if it\u2019s pulling fossil fuels from the ground to burn, because it rates better than peer energy companies.\n\nAre Those the Only Controversies?\n\nNo. Any boom brings in opportunists, and regulators have warned of some potentially misleading statements.\n\nThat could include firms claiming to be ESG-driven but owning shares in companies with low ESG scores. It\u2019s reminiscent of how products along supermarket aisles get accused of \"greenwashing,\" or pitching their wares as \"green\" even if they\u2019re not.\n\nPart of that could be how big the ESG industry has become, with some players taking a lighter touch.\n\nSome funds pledge not to own stocks of any companies seen as dangerous, for example. Others will try to own only companies that get the highest ratings from scorekeepers on ESG issues. Still others try to buy only companies that score the best within their specific industry, even if the score is very low overall.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSuch nuance can make for confusion among investors trying to find the right ESG fund for them."}, {"title": "Shark Tank's Kevin O'Leary calls AOC \u2018great at killing jobs,' blasts blue states as 'uninvestable'", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/media/shark-tanks-kevin-oleary-calls-aoc-great-killing-jobs-blasts-blue-states-uninvestable", "tag": "MEDIA", "content": "Investor and \"Shark Tank\" star Kevin O\u2019Leary claimed Friday that blue states in America are \"uninvestable\" thanks to regulations enacted by politicians and quipped that Rep.

The three co-founders have simultaneously advocated for policies benefiting those ventures through the nonprofit.\n\n\"It's a shocking amount of money that they're hauling in with this scheme of theirs,\" Tom Pyle, the president of the Institute for Energy Research, told Fox News Digital in an interview. \"I call it Big Green Inc. It is literally a business for these guys and they cloak themselves in the mantra of trying to save the planet.

That\u2019s called mission alignment,\" the spokesperson told Fox News Digital.\n\nAlthough Rewiring America has an increasingly more prominent role guiding policies at the state and federal level \u2013 it notably had a presence at a Dec. 14 electrification summit and at an event celebrating the Inflation Reduction Act, both at the White House \u2013 the group's donors are shielded from public view. The group doesn't file federal tax forms since it is sponsored by the Windward Fund, a nonprofit that is part of the billion-dollar dark money network managed by the Washington, D.C.-based Arabella Advisors.\n\nThe only public contribution to Rewiring America is a 2020 grant worth $300,000 from the left-wing nonprofit Rockefeller Brothers Fund.\n\nINTERNAL BIDEN ADMIN MEMO SHOWS IT WAS SERIOUS ABOUT BANNING GAS STOVES BEFORE PUBLIC UPROAR\n\nAmong its key objectives, Rewiring America has maintained that Americans must broadly electrify their homes in an effort to combat climate change and has advocated for massive-spending climate programs that rival those introduced during the Great Depression and World War II. Activists have long argued in favor of electrification to reduce consumer dependence on natural gas and to ensure power across sectors is supplied by renewable sources like wind and solar.\n\nThe group was at the center of a recent move to restrict gas stove usage. Rewiring America research associate Talor Gruenwald was listed as the lead author on a study published in December linking childhood asthma to gas stoves. The study was promoted by Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm and used to justify greater restrictions on the appliance.\n\n\"Just to talk quickly about the benefits of electrification \u2013 from our count, 42% of all emissions come from decisions that are made at kitchen tables. That is the cars we drive as well as how we heat our homes, heat the water in our homes, cook our food and dry our clothing,\" Laskey, who in addition to co-founding Rewiring America serves as its executive chairman, said during the White House electrification event in December.\n\n\"The benefits are tremendous here,\" he continued. \"The reality is that, with clean electric machines, we don't need to sacrifice. These machines are better, they're better performing, they're less expensive and more reliable to own, and they will improve the quality of people's lives.\"\n\nDEMOCRAT-LED CITIES ARE ALREADY MOVING FORWARD WITH GAS STOVE BANS THAT WILL AFFECT MILLIONS\n\nWhile Laskey was introduced at the White House event as the chair of Rewiring America, he is also involved in several green ventures and has made millions of dollars of the sale of another.\n\nIn 2018, he joined the board of Arcadia Power, an online utility company that aims to increase access to green energy. The company, which has received millions of dollars in seed funding, says its mission is to \"stop climate change by breaking the fossil fuel monopoly.\"\n\nLaskey was also listed in 2021 as an investor in green energy workforce training firm Greenwork. And he is identified as a strategic adviser for Voltus, a company that markets itself as \"a leading provider of cash-generating energy products.\"\n\nOpower, an energy efficiency firm Laskey co-founded in 2007, was sold for $532 million to Oracle in 2016, the Washington Business Journal reported at the time. Laskey earned about $65.7 million from the sale.\n\nDEMOCRATS, ECO GROUPS TAKE AIM AT OTHER HOME APPLIANCES AMID GAS STOVE DEBATE\n\n\"We're going to have to aggregate demand. There's a lot that's been done nationally, but this is ultimately also a local problem because there's local building code, permitting,\" Laskey said at the December event. \"We have government-owned housing, we have weatherization programs. These need to become electrification programs as well, as well as military housing, to aggregate demand.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Griffith, who is Rewiring America's chief scientist, is the founder and chief scientist of green energy research firm Otherlab. The firm has raised at least $100 million in funding from investors, The Washington Post reported in 2021, and has received millions of dollars more in federal funding.\n\nFor example, an energy efficiency project Otherlab was involved in received $5.4 million in federal funding, an Otherlab solar project received $4.3 million and a wind turbine project received another $2.9 million.\n\nOtherlab's energy efficiency project Stow Energy has spun off into a company and lists Griffith as its sole board member and \"energy guru.\" The company works to electrify the residential sector.\n\nGriffith also founded and remains on the board of directors for Sunfolding, a solar energy company that received $32 million in additional funding in 2019. And Makani Power, a wind energy company Griffith founded in 2006, was purchased by Google in 2013 for an undisclosed amount.\n\nLike Laskey, Griffith has advocated for policies which would seemingly benefit his business ventures through Rewiring America.\n\nGREEN ENERGY PROJECTS FACE STARK ENVIRONMENTAL, LOCAL OPPOSITION NATIONWIDE\n\n\"Rewiring America is a new non-profit I founded with Alex Laskey, a clean energy entrepreneur, to help mobilize America to address climate change and jump-start the economy by electrifying everything,\" Griffith wrote in a blog post in 2020.\n\n\"We have to rewrite the federal, state, and local rules and regulations that were created for the fossil-fueled world and are preventing the U.S. from having the cheapest electricity ever,\" he added. \"Then, we have to finance our transition to a zero-carbon energy system with a low-interest \u2018climate loan.'\"\n\nMatusiak, the CEO of Rewiring America, is a co-founder and managing partner of Purpose Venture Group, a climate-focused consulting firm. The firm mainly advises and guides nonprofits that are focused on environmental and climate change issues.\n\nAccording to its website, Purpose Venture Group \"incubated Rewiring America into the leading voice and a national authority on electrification, with over $20mm in funding commitments to date\" and provided consulting work for Arcadia Power, the company Laskey serves on the board of.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe firm has also provided consulting services for solar company Posigen and energy efficiency company Dvele which recently announced it had received $15 million in seed funding.

And that\u2019s a high point -- approval went as low as 23% in June 2022. His ratings are also well underwater on the economy (36% approve, 62% disapprove), immigration (36-61%), guns (36-60%), and the opioid epidemic (36-56%).\n\nAs the survey was underway, Biden made a surprise visit to Kyiv (Feb. 20) and gave a major speech in Warsaw reaffirming the U.S. commitment to Ukraine (Feb. 21).\n\nHis ratings are similar on national security (45-51%). Approval on foreign policy is up 2 points since October and stands at a high mark (43-52%).

The poll finds 49% think Biden exceeded his authority under the Constitution by creating the program, while almost as many, 44%, say it was within his power.\n\nOn the program itself, a majority supports canceling at least some college debt, as 25% say all of it should be forgiven and another 37% would cancel up to $20,000 for individuals with annual income of $125,000 or less. Thirty-six percent wouldn\u2019t forgive any of it.\n\nDemocrats would forgive at least some debt (87%) and say Biden acted within his authority (70%), while Republicans say none should be forgiven (61%) and the president overstepped his authority (79%). Independents say forgive some debt (62%), but also think Biden overstepped (54%).\n\nVoters with and without a college degree are equally likely to support canceling some debt, but more of those without a degree think Biden exceeded his authority creating the program.\n\nDEBUNKING BIDEN'S 4 BIGGEST LIES ABOUT THE ECONOMY\n\n-- Low approval of White House handling of Feb. 3 Ohio toxic train derailment.\n\nThirty-three percent approve, while 57% disapprove of how the administration is dealing with the aftermath of the Ohio train derailment.

When that news crossed the tape, the financial markets seemed to rally, indicating the professional investing community is happy with the result.\n\nSo, why does inflation feel so much worse under President Joe Biden?\n\nThe CPI measures a large basket of consumer goods from airfares to used cars and many things in between.\n\nREPUBLICANS BLAST BIDEN AFTER LATEST INFLATION REPORT, SAY PRESIDENT 'LIVING IN AN ALTERNATE REALITY'\n\nBut the CPI does not capture the true impact of inflation on families. To be more accurate, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) \u2014 publishers of the CPI \u2014 decided to measure \"core inflation\" by excluding food and energy prices, which can be more volatile. It was a nice try, but food and energy, such as gasoline, are a large part of the goods purchased by your average family. This explains why the CPI cooling and a trip to the grocery store can elicit different outcomes.\n\nThis data is not representative of the \"feel\" of inflation for two reasons. The first is that month to month, consumers do not buy most of the goods on the index. Airline tickets and used (or new) cars are infrequent purchases, so changes in those items do not impact consumers consistently.\n\nSecond, when consumers are feeling financial pressure, they change their purchasing habits \u2014 what economists call the \"substitution effect.\" Consequently, the mix of goods purchased changes as well as the specific goods purchased within a category, such as going from a name brand to a store brand. In summary, the CPI is a broad measure of inflation but perhaps fails as a measure of inflationary impact.\n\nTo really measure the impact of inflation on main street, we need to create an alternative price index: the Omelet Price Index (OPI). The OPI is composed of the ingredients to make a three-egg, ham-and-cheese omelet with toast: eggs, ham, American cheese and sliced white bread. (No fancy Gruy\u00e8re cheese or eight-grain bread in our diner.) The OPI also addresses the shortcomings of the CPI: It is comprised of four staple ingredients that are consistently consumed by families across the country.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThe recipe for the omelet is three eggs, two slices of ham, two slices of American cheese and two slices of white bread. The OPI was calculated based on that mix.\n\nWhat does the OPI tell us? Well, according to the BLS data, the price of eggs (grade A, large, per dozen) is up 150.0% from January 2022 to January 2023. Ham (boneless, excluding canned, per pound) is up 9.7%, American processed cheese (per pound) is up 19.7%, and bread (white) is up 21.4% per pound.\n\nSo, whipping up that three-egg ham and cheese omelet with a side of toast has increased in price by 49.9% from January 2022 to January 2023.\n\nThe BLS basket of goods has risen 6.4% year-to-year, but my favorite breakfast is up almost 50%.

But in certain ways, it does fall short. The OPI\u00a9 tries to simplify that idea and make it more applicable to the average family by focusing on staple goods that we all buy. You can do this in different ways; for example, what about a Burger and Beer Index (BBI)? Or upgrade to a Western Omelet Index (WOI) to get some vegetables in there as well.\n\nYou get the point.

But he admitted he waited too long to respond publicly to the incident.

Meanwhile, U.S.-born, non-Hispanic Whites comprised 56% of the total labor force in 2021 but only 50% of construction workers.\n\nThe data also showed that foreign-born Hispanics make up 8% of the total labor force and 24% of the construction workforce and that, overall, Hispanics \u2014 U.S. and foreign born \u2014 make up 37% of construction workers and 18% of the total labor force.\n\nHowever, U.S.-born Black Americans are underrepresented in construction, the data finds, with native-born African Americans comprising 10% of the total labor force in 2021 but only 5% of construction workers.\n\nOther estimates have put the figure at Black Americans making up 11% of construction workers, Hispanics making up 28% and Whites making up 53%.\n\nBUTTIGIEG DODGES QUESTIONS WHILE HIS PRESS SECRETARY REFUSES TO BE ON CAMERA IN EAST PALESTINE\n\nMore broadly, the overall number of immigrants \u2014 legal and illegal \u2014 working was up 2 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to the same quarter of 2019, before the COVID pandemic hit, according to a CIS analysis. That analysis was based on the Current Population Survey collected by the Census Bureau for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Meanwhile, there were 1.9 million fewer U.S.-born Americans working over the same time period.\n\nLast week was hardly the first time Buttigieg as transportation secretary has brought up the issues of race, ethnicity and alleged inequality in the U.S.\n\nButtigieg caused a stir in April after he said \"there is racism physically built into highways.\"\n\nIn November, he was asked by journalist April Ryan during a press briefing how he would \"deconstruct the racism that was built into our roadways,\" and he gave a response.\n\n\"I'm still surprised that some people were surprised when I pointed to the fact that if a highway was built for the purpose of dividing a white and a black neighborhood or if an underpass was constructed such that a bus carrying mostly black and Puerto Rican kids to a beach, or that would have been, in New York was designed too low for it to pass by, that obviously reflects racism that went into those design choices,\" said Buttigieg.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Department of Transportation didn't respond to a request for comment for this story.\n\nButtigieg ran unsuccessfully for president as a Democrat in 2020 and has been floated as a potential Democratic presidential candidate in 2024 if President Biden doesn't seek re-election.

As spelled out in the Fair Housing Act of 1968 \u2014 and found in realtors\u2019 offices across the country \u2014 it precludes \"discrimination in the sale, rental and financing of dwellings \u2026 based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex (including gender identity and sexual orientation), familial status, and disability.\" In other words, those who can afford to rent or buy should not be precluded from doing so for reasons having nothing to do with the ability to pay.\n\nBut for the Biden administration\u2019s Department of Housing and Urban Development, fair housing is more \u2014 much more. In proposed regulations that would touch any jurisdiction that accepts any sort of HUD funding, fair housing must mean a plan to \"promote equity in their communities, decrease segregation, and increase access to opportunity and community assets for people of color and other underserved communities.\"\n\nTranslated that means that the route to upward mobility for disadvantaged minorities lies through their relocation to more affluent communities, where they will no longer be \"underserved.\"\n\nIRS ACCUSED OF USING 'RACIAL EQUITY' FOR AUDITS TARGETING WHITE, ASIAN TAXPAYERS\n\nThe details as to how this should be done run more than 200 pages. Those required to comply will include more than 1,200 cities and counties receiving HUD funding. All will be required to develop \"equity plans.\"\n\nSuch equity could mean anything from building low-income housing to redrawing school district lines for racial or socio-economic integration, all as assessed by the HUD bureaucracy.\n\nBoth those concerned about the best routes to upward mobility for the poor and those concerned about administrative state overreach have reasons to be dubious.\n\nOpposition to the \"affirmatively furthering fair housing\" (AFFH) regulations will undoubtedly be labeled as racist defense of White suburbs. That is certainly how Donald Trump\u2019s 2020 decision to suspend a previous Obama-era version of the rules was characterized. As CNN Business put it then, Trump was merely protecting neighborhoods with \"higher-than-average shares of white households\" from low-income housing.\n\nIt has of late been a liberal mantra that children\u2019s future should not be determined by the ZIP Code where they grow up \u2014 and the HUD plan is meant to disperse low-income households where they are presumed to benefit from better schools and parks, which presumably city governments are inherently incapable of providing.\n\nThe underlying social science rationale, cited by HUD, is that of Harvard economists Raj Chetty and Lawrence Katz, who examined data in a 1990s HUD program called Moving to Opportunity \u2014 in which a small number of low-income households were relocated to higher-income areas.\n\nAs per HUD\u2019s summary, \"Children who move to low-poverty neighborhoods have increased academic achievement, greater long-term chances of success, and less intergenerational poverty.\"\n\nYet the actual Harvard study is far more nuanced, although it finds that \"every extra year of childhood spent in a low-poverty environment appears to be beneficial,\" it also notes that \"for older children (those between ages 13-18), we find that moving to a lower-poverty neighborhood has a statistically insignificant or slightly negative effect.\" It is hard to imagine a government effort that would limit participation for households based on the age of their children.\n\nMore broadly, however, HUD fails to acknowledge that sustained upward mobility is based on the constructive life decisions made at the family level \u2014 including marriage and employment. These are the building blocks of the economic gains that enable moves to better neighborhoods. It is such moves that must be protected by enforcement of anti-discrimination law.\n\nThe details as to how this should be done run more than 200 pages. Those required to comply will include more than 1,200 cities and counties receiving HUD funding. All will be required to develop \"equity plans.\"\n\nHistorically, it was the federal government, specifically the Federal Housing Administration, which engaged in racial discrimination by refusing to guarantee mortgages in racially changing neighborhoods.\n\nHUD would bring us to a new era of color consciousness in housing policy, in the name of \"equity\" \u2014 comparable life outcomes for those making distinct life choices.\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if those objecting include the suburban African-American middle class, which has worked hard and played by the rules. Their concern was captured in a recent New York Times article about \"black flight\" from racially integrated Shaker Heights, Ohio. It quoted a Black library staffer who said, \"There\u2019s a group of African Americans that have achieved and have it together. And then there\u2019s the group that\u2019s still caught in not having achieved. \u2026 And I come from the mind-set: Separate yourselves at all costs from the ones who might still be struggling.\"\n\nSuburbs do need a great variety of non-single family housing types. But they should not be coerced by Washington to build new low-income housing projects.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThen there\u2019s what can be seen as the constitutional question raised by the AFFH regulations. HUD\u2019s lengthy proposal is based on the thinnest of reeds in the 1968 Fair Housing Law, which, following its main anti-discrimination language, goes on direct other Federal agencies \"to administer their programs \u2026 relating to housing and urban development \u2026 in a manner affirmatively to further\" the policies of the act.\n\nIt is into that small lane that HUD drives its big, regulatory truck, with communities across the country in its path. HUD defines equity as \"access to high quality schools, equitable employment opportunities, reliable transportation services, parks and recreation facilities, community centers, community-based supportive services, law enforcement and emergency services, healthcare services, grocery stores, retail establishments, infrastructure and municipal services, libraries, and banking and financial institutions.\"\n\nAs those aware of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn the EPA\u2019s Clean Power plan know well, the court is increasingly aware of regulatory requirements that go beyond legislative intent.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLocal jurisdictions receiving HUD funds would seem to have grounds to sue to block the proposed rule, which would impose new requirements to receive previously accepted funds continent and new requirements. In 2012, the court overturned the portion of the Affordable Care Act requiring states to expand Medicaid for that reason. Justices Elena Kagan and Stephen Breyer concurred.\n\nRacial discrimination in housing is pernicious.

Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., and cosponsored by 12 fellow Republicans \u2014 is designed to give energy companies increased certainty in the federal permitting process for oil and gas drilling in an effort to boost production and lower energy prices. Boebert said her bill would counter efforts from the Biden administration to introduce red tape and stifle production.\n\n\"The Biden administration is colluding with Green New Deal extremists to slow down energy leasing, clog up the bureaucratic pipeline, and threaten American energy producers with frivolous lawsuits,\" Boebert said in a statement to Fox News Digital.\n\n\"My American Energy Act cuts red tape to unleash American energy by extending the term of APDs from two years to four years to reduce unnecessary paperwork, ensuring agencies process permits under a valid existing lease regardless of any unrelated civil action, and by prohibiting activist judges from unilaterally vacating valid energy leases.\"\n\nFOSSIL FUEL PROFITS ARE VITAL FOR GREEN ENERGY PROJECTS DEMS ROUTINELY TOUT\n\nThe legislation mainly focuses on ensuring that the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), an Interior Department subagency tasked with managing federal lands, approves applications for permits to drill (APD) in a timely fashion. Oil and gas companies are required to file an APD once they identify a deposit on a lease that can be tapped for resources.\n\nThe Biden administration has been accused of purposely delaying APDs in an effort to prevent fossil fuel extraction. According to BLM data, there were 4,896 pending APDs on federal lands and another 179 on Indian property as of Jan. 31.\n\nGREEN ENERGY PROJECTS FACE STARK ENVIRONMENTAL, LOCAL OPPOSITION NATIONWIDE\n\nAnd, according to Boebert's office, permitting times have increased from an average of 94 days in June 2019 to 182 days under the Biden administration last year. During fiscal year 2022, the BLM an average of 233 drilling permits per month while it approved 400 drilling permits per month in fiscal year 2020.\n\n\"In short, H.R. 1067 will help reduce gas prices by providing certainty for responsible energy production and preventing baseless litigation,\" Boebert continued. \"With the price at the pump skyrocketing and the international energy market destabilizing, the world needs American energy now more than ever.\"\n\nWhile gasoline prices have fallen from their all-time high of more than $5 per gallon in June, they remain about 45% higher than when President Biden took office in January 2021.\n\nOil production on federal lands, meanwhile, fell to 12.28 million barrels per day in November, the latest month with data.

But in recent months, the president has taken this dishonest strategy to a whole new level, routinely misleading the American people to score political points, especially on topics related to economic growth.\n\nThe following are four of Biden\u2019s biggest lies about the economy, as well as the data you need to prove to friends and family that the White House has not been nearly as successful as it has been claiming.\n\nLie 1: America\u2019s inflation problem is improving.\n\nWhen Biden entered the White House in January 2021, inflation was a miniscule 1.4%. Then, Biden signed into the law the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan and a $1.1 trillion infrastructure package. Shortly thereafter, inflation skyrocketed.\n\nDespite rising inflation, Biden and his Democratic colleagues for months inexplicably chose to ignore the data and instead push for more spending programs, in the process claiming that the sudden surge in inflation was merely \"transitory.\" Many in the administration also said that inflation would subside by late 2021. They were wrong.\n\nCAN US MINT FIX THE DEBT CEILING CRISIS AND CONJURE UP A $1 TRILLION PLATINUM COIN?\n\nToday, two years into the Biden era, inflation remains stubbornly high. The 12-month increase in the consumer price index was 6.4% in January. But rather than acknowledge that his policies have failed, Biden has repeatedly claimed inflation is improving and prices are going down.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s accurate to say the rate of inflation has eased compared to the record numbers in the summer of 2022, inflation remains at historically high levels. What would have cost $100 in January 2020 costs nearly $116 today. The rate of increase in prices may have dropped in recent months, but overall, prices are still much higher.\n\nMost importantly, there has been no sign that we\u2019re headed toward price deflation anytime soon. And without deflation, prices will continue to be much greater than they were prior to Biden becoming president.\n\nLie 2: Biden \"created 12.7 million new jobs.\"\n\nThroughout his two years in the Oval Office, Biden has made exaggerated or outright dishonest claims about resurrecting America\u2019s labor market. For example, in his recent State of the Union Address, Biden said that he has created \"12.7 million new jobs, more jobs created in two years than any president has ever created in four years.\"\n\nBIDEN IS ALREADY SPENDING TOWARD $1 TRILLION IN STUDENT LOAN HANDOUTS\n\nAlthough the figure is technically accurate, it\u2019s wildly misleading without being put in its proper context. In March and April 2020, the U.S. economy lost more than 22 million jobs due to economic shutdowns issued in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Prior to Biden entering the White House, many states had already started to reopen their economies. As a result, businesses were recovering jobs at a record-setting pace.\n\nBiden did nothing to spur additional job creation during his first two years in office. The millions of jobs added during his first year as president were due almost entirely to state governments choosing to lift economic restrictions put into place at the start of the pandemic, as well as the development of vaccines that limited the number of coronavirus-related deaths.\n\nIf anything, Biden\u2019s anti-energy policies, tax increases, huge spending bills, and overregulation hindered what could have been an even more vigorous job recovery.\n\nLie 3: Biden \"cut the deficit by more than $1.7 trillion.\"\n\nThe White House has on numerous occasions claimed that Biden has made significant cuts to government spending. Most recently, it suggested Bident has reduced the deficit by $1.7 trillion. Like Biden\u2019s jobs claim, this assertion is incredibly misleading and dishonest.\n\nIn 2020, the deficit skyrocketed as Congress passed several multitrillion-dollar COVID-19 relief bills \u2014 all of which had received significant support from Democrats. By 2021, when Biden became president, some of the emergency spending started to come off the books, automatically reducing the deficit.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nOver his first two years in office, Biden has consistently pressed for trillions more in additional government spending programs, including unnecessary handouts like \"canceling\" student loan debt.\n\nBiden deserves absolutely no credit for deficit reduction. In fact, he has been the most fiscally irresponsible president in history. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the country is now on track to add an average of $1.6 trillion to the national debt every year for the next decade \u2014 adding far more to the national debt than in any other era of U.S. history, excluding the recent pandemic period.\n\nLie 4: Biden said he wouldn\u2019t and hasn\u2019t raised taxes on any American family earning less than $400,000 per year.\n\nDuring his campaign for the presidency in 2020, Joe Biden promised that he would not raise taxes on U.S. households earning less than $400,000 annually. This was a lie, one that he continues to repeat despite numerous evidence that earners who fall below the $400,000 threshold are paying more in taxes, directly or indirectly, because of Biden\u2019s policies.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFor example, Americans for Tax Reform, a nonpartisan think tank, reports that the Inflation Reduction Act alone \"raises taxes by more than $750 billion and includes a number of new energy taxes on natural gas production, crude oil and coal that will be passed on to consumers in the form of higher gasoline prices and energy bills.\" These energy taxes, and many others too, will be one way or another by virtually all American families, including millions who are living paycheck to paycheck.\n\nPresident Biden\u2019s foolish policies have made the U.S. economy substantially weaker and driven the national debt to levels we\u2019ve never seen before. And unless he changes direction on numerous policy positions soon, things are only going to get worse from here.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JUSTIN HASKINS\n\nChris Talgo (Ctalgo@heartland.org) is editorial director and a research fellow at The Heartland Institute."}, {"title": "South Dakota Gov.

The Republican caucus voted over the weekend for the general sales tax cut, favoring its general scope of relief.\n\nRepublican House Majority Leader Will Mortenson said that after deep scrutiny on each of the proposals, his fellow representatives agreed that a single exemption to groceries was too narrow of an issue to tackle in a tax cut.\n\n\"The caucus decided that they would prefer to keep a broad sales tax base and cut the rates,\" Mortenson said. \"We wanted to cut taxes on food and fireworks and fencing supplies and everything.\"\n\nSOUTH DAKOTA GOV.

And there is little farmers can do beyond the steps they have already taken to try to keep the virus out.\n\nUnlike past years, the virus that causes highly pathogenic avian influenza found a way to survive through the heat of last summer, leading to a rise in cases reported in the fall.\n\nThe outbreak is already more widespread than the last major bird flu outbreak in 2015, but it hasn't proven as costly yet partly because the government and industry applied lessons learned eight years ago.\n\nCOULD A BIRD FLU PANDEMIC SPREAD TO HUMANS? HERE\u2019S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW\n\n\"The past year has been devastating for the turkey industry as we experience, unequivocally, the worst HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza) outbreak in the industry\u2019s history,\" National Turkey Federation spokeswoman Shelby Newman said.\n\nIn the current outbreak, 58.4 million birds have been slaughtered on more than 300 commercial farms in 47 states. That is because any time the virus is detected, the entire flock on that farm \u2014 which can number in the millions \u2014 must be killed to limit the spread of the disease. Only Hawaii, Louisiana and West Virginia have yet to report a case of bird flu. Iowa \u2014 the nation's biggest egg producer \u2014 leads the nation with nearly 16 million birds slaughtered.\n\nIn 2015, about 50 million chickens and turkeys were slaughtered on more than 200 farms in 15 states.\n\nThat previous outbreak remains the most expensive animal health disaster in U.S. history. The federal government spent nearly $1 billion to deal with infected birds, clean up barns and compensate farmers. It cost the industry roughly $3 billion as farmers incurred additional costs and lost money when they didn\u2019t have any birds on their farms.\n\nThis bills continue to pile up this year as cases spread, and that includes the cost to consumers.\n\nEgg prices shot up to $4.82 a dozen in January from $1.93 a year earlier, according to the latest government figures. That spike prompted calls for a price-gouging investigation although the industry maintains that the combination of bird flu and significantly higher feed, fuel and labor costs is what\u2019s driving prices so high.\n\nThe price for a pound of chicken breast was $4.32 in January. That\u2019s down slightly from last fall when the price peaked at $4.75, but it is up significantly from the year before when chicken breasts were selling for $3.73 per pound.\n\nREMEMBER THE FEAR ABOUT FLU FLARE-UPS OVER THE HOLIDAYS? DIDN'T HAPPEN, SAYS CDC\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics doesn\u2019t track retail turkey prices the same way as part of its inflation data, but the Agriculture Department says the wholesale price of turkey went from $1.29 per pound last January just before the bird flu outbreak began to $1.72 per pound last month.\n\nThe number of birds slaughtered peaked last spring at almost 21 million in March, leaving farmers leery of what they must face in the months ahead. University of Georgia virus researcher David Stallknecht said there is some hope that this spring might not be quite as bad because turkeys and chickens may have developed some immunity to the virus.\n\nThe key problem with bird flu is that the highly contagious virus is spread easily by wild birds through their droppings and nasal discharges. Despite the best efforts of farmers, it is hard to keep the virus out.\n\nFarmers have gone to great lengths by requiring workers to shower and change clothes before entering barns, sanitizing trucks that enter a farm and investing in separate sets of tools for every barn. Some farms have even upgraded barn ventilation and installed laser systems to discourage wild birds from congregating.\n\n\"We recommend all producers redouble their efforts to protect their birds through good biosecurity practices,\" said Lyndsay Cole, a spokeswoman for the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service that's leading the government's response.\n\nFarmers began following those steps after the 2015 outbreak, and this outbreak has only reinforced the need to tighten biosecurity.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"America\u2019s egg farmers continue to double-down on biosecurity protocols to protect our flocks and maintain a stable egg supply. We are grateful that there has been little to no farm-to-farm spread in this current outbreak,\" said Oscar Garrison, senior vice president of food safety and regulatory affairs at the United Egg Producers trade group.\n\nPoultry and egg producers, partnering with the government, are parsing this outbreak for new lessons in keeping birds healthy.\n\n\"That\u2019s really the key \u2013 early detection. It\u2019s kind of like a forest fire - the earlier you detect it, the easier it is to contain and eradicate,\" National Chicken Council spokesman Tom Super said.\n\nOfficials say bird flu doesn\u2019t represent a significant threat to human health. Human cases are extremely rare and none of the infected birds are allowed into the nation\u2019s food supply. And properly cooking poultry to 165 degrees Fahrenheit will kill any viruses.\n\nThere has only been one human case of bird flu confirmed during this outbreak and that was a man who had been helping slaughter and remove infected birds from a Colorado farm.

If the Fed, plays along, it would pay for the coin by waving its hands and typing \"1,000,000,000,000\" on an excel sheet \u2013 thereby conjuring the needful dollars. Is this legitimate?\n\n\n\nCongress granted the U.S. Mint the power to mint coins that honestly contain what they claim. For example, a one-ounce gold coin must contain one gold ounce. Creating a platinum coin with an imaginary price to fund government operations would mark a radical departure from the historic understanding of the role and powers of the mint.\n\nThe United States Constitution (Article 1, Sec. 8, Clause 5) grants Congress \"power To coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin, and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures.\" The Coinage Act of 1792 established the United States Mint for this purpose. It allowed citizens to convert gold, silver and other metals into coins issued by the government mint, which attested to the value and purity of those coins. This service was initially provided nearly free of charge, other than a small fee to cover the expenses of the process.\n\nThe mission of the Mint changed as it became an adjunct to the Federal Reserve, to which Congress delegated expansion or contraction of the money supply under the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. As a result, the mint retained responsibilities and powers delegated by Congress in Title 31 of the United States Code.. 31 U.S.C. \u00a75111(a)(1), which instructs the secretary of the Treasury to produce the coins described in Section 5112 \" in amounts the Secretary decides are necessary to meet the needs of the United States.\" Those coins, from pennies to half-dollars, are specified \u2013 along with their compositions \u2013 in 31 U.S.C. \u00a75112.\n\nDEMOCRATS' SPENDING THREATENS AMERICANS' HIGH STANDARD OF LIVING\n\nSince the creation of the Mint, the treasurer has ensured that there are enough coins in circulation to ensure that those engaged in everyday commerce can conduct transactions without having to resort to giving change in candy, as is done in some countries with coin shortages. The Mint sends its newly minted coins to the Federal Reserve, which then distributes them to its member banks as needed.\n\nThe Mint produces about 14 billion coins \u2013 worth some $1.1 billion \u2013 each year. That\u2019s roughly the same level of production as in 1976, despite massive population and economic growth. With more transactions being done via check or credit card, there has been no need for a large increase in coinage.\n\nCongress further expressly authorized the Mint to strike commemorative coins and collectibles that may be sold to the public at a markup. It may also produce pure gold and silver coins \u2013 typically not used for everyday commercial transactions \u2013 sufficient \"to meet public demand\" and made available to the public at a cost not exceeding the production plus marketing expenses (Section 5112(i) and (f).\n\nThere is no reason to believe that Congress, when it enacted this statutory provision largely for the creation of souvenir coins, also intended to give the Mint effective control of the money supply, which is exactly what would happen if the Mint could issue coins in nonsense values like $1 trillion.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nFurthermore, exercise of such power \u2013 even if lawful \u2013 would stoke economic mayhem by inducing unlimited increases in the amount of dollars in existence.\n\nToday, Treasury has only very limited capacity to issue U.S. currency notes \u2013 only up to $300 million may be outstanding and in circulation. (31 U.S. Code Section 5115) and none may be held or used for reserve. These are not to be confused with Federal Reserve Notes we think of as cash. Although the U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing produces these notes, this is done at the behest of the Federal Reserve under the authority given the central bank by Congress under the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 that actually delegated responsibility over money creation to the Fed.\n\nMinting $1 trillion coins dutifully bought by the Fed would effectively end the supposed independence of the Federal Reserve. Treasury has already dramatically eroded the separation between the politically motivated administration and the supposed neutral experts at the Federal Reserve by effectively forcing the Fed to buy trillions in new debt during COVID lockdowns.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBut never has the U.S. Mint used its limited minting authority as a mechanism to create coins with fake denominations for the purpose of funding government operations.\n\nSuch a concept lies in the realm of banana republics.

Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., now serves as a partner to a D.C. lobbying firm that has received more than $300,000 from a group that celebrates clean energy and pushes for a transition away from coal.\n\nPatrick Hayes, who served as Manchin's chief of staff from 2015 to 2019, joined Kountoupes Denham Carr & Reid (KDCR), a lobbying firm based in the nation's capital, as a partner in 2021. Since 2021, the firm, according to U.S. Senate Lobbying Disclosure records, has been paid at least $315,000 for lobbying activities by a coal transition group named Just Transition Fund (JTF).\n\nThough coal production slowed in the past decade, coal accounts for most of West Virginia's energy use and the industry contributed $14 billion to the state's economy in 2019. Manchin has spoken about the need to innovate new energy sources rather than eliminate fossil fuels.\n\nSelf-described on its website as \"the only national fund solely focused on coal community transition,\" JTF says it works to \"leverage public and private resources, and guide policy change to accelerate a just economic transition.\"\n\nJOE MANCHIN CALLS 'BULL----' ON DEMOCRATS\u2019 PUSH TO QUICKLY END FOSSIL FUELS\n\nAdditionally, JTF \u2013 which is active in West Virginia, the second-largest coal producer in the nation, according to the Energy Information Administration \u2013 promotes on its website the \"transition away from coal.\"\n\nHayes first registered as a lobbyist for JTF in June 2021, lobbying disclosure records show. Since the third quarter of 2022, records indicate that Hayes has served as the sole lobbyist from KDCR representing JTF.\n\nSince taking on the role at the firm, Hayes, according to a September 2021 report from the Washington Post, has \"gone on to lobby Manchin's office.\"\n\nHayes, according to the second quarter lobbying disclosure filed by the firm, lobbied on issues \"related to economic development, workforce training, and healthcare for coal workers and their communities.\"\n\nThe same issues, according to KDCR's disclosures from the fourth quarter of 2021 to the fourth quarter of 2022, have been lobbied by Hayes. The 2021 third quarter form reveals Hayes lobbied the U.S. Senate and the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) on those issues. President Biden appointed Manchin's wife, Gayle Manchin, to serve as federal co-chair of the federal government agency months prior and was sworn into the role in May 2021.\n\nHayes also took part in a JTF event promoting the American Rescue Plan, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nIn an August 2022 tweet, JTF offered further support for the Inflation Reduction Act, sharing a quote from an article that reads: \"The IRA opens the door to new cheap and clean generation resources. And it does it all with an eye toward the energy-dependent and rural communities that need it most.\"\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act, as highlighted by Americans for Tax Reform, would impose a regressive tax on American oil and gas development that will drive up the cost of household energy bills in violation of Biden\u2019s pledge not to raise taxes on anyone making less than $400,000 a year.\n\n\u2018RETIRE OR GET FIRED\u2019: SENATE GOP CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE TARGETS MANCHIN, RED-STATE DEMOCRATS WITH AD CAMPAIGN\n\nThrough its Twitter account, JTF has also promoted several initiatives, including \"climate justice,\" the Black Lives Matter movement, and the World Economic Forum's plans for a transition to \"net zero\" emissions.\n\nIn a September 2022 press release, JTF's Heidi Binko, the group's co-founder and executive director, said she was \"thrilled\" about $62.8 million in rewards from the U.S. Economic Development Administration to transform \"West Virginia's hardest-hit coal communities into a hub of green innovation and clean-tech industries\" and praised Biden for making \"economic transition in energy-impacted communities core to its broader agenda on environmental justice.\"\n\n\"Economically distressed, transitioning coal communities must know that a vibrant future in a low-carbon economy is achievable,\" Binko said at the time. \"The award of this historic funding for the ACT Now Coalition in West Virginia sends a powerful message that when local communities, the public sector and private businesses align to drive change and can secure transformative federal funding to deliver it, a brighter economic future is within reach.\"\n\nFox News Digital did not receive an immediate response from Manchin's office on whether the senator has had conversations with Hayes about his lobbying efforts since he left his role from the office in 2019.\n\nManchin, who has represented West Virginia in the Senate since 2010, often takes issue with the Biden administration's comments and actions related to clean energy as he attempts to appease those with coal-related jobs in his state.\n\nEarlier this month, Manchin called out his Democratic colleagues who want to quickly transition the U.S. away from oil and natural gas as a source of energy .\n\n\"This is bull----. So, they\u2019re going to basically starve us out of energy that we have a tremendous, abundant supply of because of their aspirational thoughts?\" Manchin told Politico, one day after Biden's State of the Union Address in which the president admitted that the country was \"still going to need oil and gas for a while.\"\n\n\"I will continue to fight, and I\u2019ll do everything I can to make sure the public knows what they\u2019re doing and what it will do to you and your economy and your lifestyle,\" Manchin claimed at the time.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn 2021, nearly 12,000 people worked in West Virginia\u2019s coal industry, according to data compiled by Statista.

After COVID idled them for so long, grade schoolers and high schoolers need to learn in the school building.\n\nBut there is a stronger case against public-sector strikes than pandemic disruption. None made that case more clearly than one of Governor Healey\u2019s predecessors as Bay State governor, Calvin Coolidge. A century ago Governor Coolidge\u2019s handling of a public-sector strike put Coolidge on the path to the U.S. Presidency and, more importantly, showed how a governor can shift political culture nationwide.\n\nThe year was 1919, and rebellion was in the air. In Russia, revolutionaries were winning the civil war against the White Army. In America, strikes plagued cities everywhere. In Seattle that February, workers from 101 unions had idled every industry\u2013public or private \u2013 in a general strike so thorough that across the city \"nothing but the tide moved,\" as someone commented.\n\nIn Boston, the mutiny came in the form of a plan to strike by the Boston police. The policemen suffered from genuine grievances. Inflation so shrank their pay packets that they struggled to cover family expenses: \"Can a man, single or married, even live on such a wage? He manages to exist, that is all,\" concluded the Boston Labor World. Rats prowled the shelves of police station houses, chewing through the leather of their helmets. Policemen or their families had given their all in the recent war.\n\nAMITY SHLAES: CALVIN COOLIDGE'S FAITH WAS THE SECRET HIS SUCCESS\n\nThe police reasoned therefore that they might prevail if they went on strike. After all, they were not proposing revolution; only to walk out for better conditions. The patrolmen affiliated not with radical unions but with the milder American Federation of Labor, led by an ally of President Woodrow Wilson, Sam Gompers. The police contracts did not permit strikes, but this fact seemed a mere technicality in the heat of the moment.\n\nAnother reason the police counted on conciliation was the governor himself, a first-termer. As a state lawmaker, Coolidge had led negotiations with textile workers before the war; surely he would negotiate with police now. The next gubernatorial contest was just two months away. Surely too Coolidge would prefer a peaceful outcome to losing control of the state capital.\n\nWhen the majority of the Boston force did walk out in September, riots indeed erupted in Boston. Crowds rampaged down streets, breaking shop windows and hurling bricks at volunteers who had offered to man intersections \u2014 Boston did not have a full stoplight system yet. Shop owners queued at police stations to apply for pistol licenses so that they might defend their wares. Injuries and deaths mounted, but the police commissioner did not cave. Gompers, the labor leader, made an indirect threat by allowing publicly that worse could come if the police commissioner did not negotiate: \"I suppose he is willing to assume the responsibility for the consequences of his action,\" Gompers muttered.\n\nWhat would Coolidge do? The governor\u2019s first move was predictable: he called out the state guard, and asked other New England governors to send their state guards to reestablish order in Boston. A few days into the riots, even the police themselves were finding themselves appalled by the violence. Gompers modulated his tone: the police strike was, he said, merely \"a \u2018natural reflex\u2019 of the futile attempts by the policemen to improving their working conditions.\" \"Cops Want to Work Again,\" read the headlines. The moment had come for conciliation.\n\nBut Coolidge did not conciliate. \"The action of the police in leaving their posts of duty is not a strike. It is a desertion.\" A contract that prohibited strikes like the policemen\u2019s was no technicality. The striking policemen were fired and would stay fired. There was a difference between an industrial worker and a public-sector worker; a public-sector worker had a duty to the public. Service was an honor. Earlier that year Coolidge had expressed the same philosophy in a terse veto of raises for legislators: \"service in the General Court is not obligatory but optional.\"\n\nNow Coolidge sent a wire to Gompers, more missile than missive. The telegraph punctuation even had the effect of artillery fire. \"YOUR ASSERTION THAT THE COMMISSIONER WAS WRONG CANNOT JUSTIFY THE WRONG OF LEAVING THE CITY UNGUARDED STOP.\" Coolidge concluded with a line of telegraphese that has rung down the decades: \"THERE IS NO RIGHT TO STRIKE AGAINST THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMA BY ANYBODY COMMA ANYWHERE COMMA ANY TIME STOP.\"\n\nThis stand was a tough one. Though many praised his move he was not sure of his own political fate post-strike. His opponent in the November gubernatorial election, Richard Long, chided Coolidge: \"a broad minded governor would have been able to satisfy them\" \u2013 the police \u2013 \"and at the same time protect the dignity and honor of Boston and Massachusetts.\"\n\n\"People applaud me a great deal but I am not sure they will vote for me,\" Coolidge wrote his father following the strike. Still, the governor noted, \"this was a service that had to be done. The result won\u2019t matter to me but it will matter a great deal to the rest of America.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nIt did. Coolidge\u2019s categoric action inspired other governors, and many mayors, all of whom were confronting their own labor unrest. When they learned of Boston they felt relief. Finally, someone had drawn the necessary line in the sand. Coolidge did win his gubernatorial election, and even Wilson spoke up, via his own telegram: \"I CONGRATULATE YOU UPON YOUR ELECTION AS A VICTORY FOR LAW AND ORDER. WHEN THAT IS THE ISSUE WE MUST ALL STAND TOGETHER.\" The freshman governor from Massachusetts suddenly became national material, and was nominated for the vice presidential slot on what proved successful \"law and order\" ticket.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn 1923, at President Warren Harding\u2019s passing, Coolidge himself became president. But his 1919 strike message inspired statesmen long past Coolidge\u2019s retirement. Even Franklin Roosevelt, that most progressive of presidents, balked at strikes by public employees: \"such action, looking toward the paralysis of government\" was \"unthinkable and intolerable.\" Public sector unions and even strikes became more common later. But today the majority of states ban strikes by public employees.\n\nThis year marks the centennial of the Coolidge presidency; Fox will be airing a documentary about Coolidge. The Coolidge story reminds us that America does not take its cues from Washington alone. When America veers off course, it matters only that someone speaks up and points the country back in the right direction. And often enough, that person is a governor.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM AMITY SHLAES"}, {"title": "Texas Gov.

This time, they\u2019re coming for your brokerage account.\n\nLate last year, SEC Chair Gary Gensler rolled out a set of far-reaching, experimental reforms that, if finalized by the agency, would fundamentally change the way retail investors\u2019 stock trades are handled. These include a set of prescriptive government mandates dictating where these trades would need to be executed and at what price.\n\nGensler claims that he needs to act quickly and act aggressively because there isn\u2019t enough competition to execute your stock trades, and you may not be getting the best price theoretically possible.\n\nGOP PUSHBACK TO 'WOKE' ESG INVESTING BEGINS TO BEAR FRUIT\n\nNever mind that the data \u2013 backed up by individual investors\u2019 real-life experiences in the market every day \u2013 show that retail investors have never had it better. Over the past few years, millions of Americans, many of whom are younger and more diverse than in decades past \u2013 have opened brokerage accounts using apps on their mobile phones and started investing at a very low cost using strategies they believe are best for themselves and their families.\n\nSo why the sudden rush by the SEC to upend and micromanage a market that already works extraordinarily well for retail investors? At its core, Gensler \u2013 a hundred millionaire, 65-year-old former Goldman Sachs partner \u2013 appears to be motivated by the view that Main Street America simply isn\u2019t capable of choosing how they should invest their own money and that they need the government to protect them from themselves.\n\nThe recent explosive growth in the number of retail investors\u2019 participating in the stock market, punctuated by extraordinary retail trading activity and market turmoil in meme stocks in January 2021, has provided a rationale \u2013 however misguided \u2013 for the SEC to act now in the name of competition and investor protection.\n\nUnder the guise of enhancing competition to execute retail investors\u2019 trades on an \"order-by-order\" basis, Gensler\u2019s rules would attack the self-directed brokerage model \u2013 and the millions of investors who use this model \u2013 by introducing significant frictions into stock trading, compressing brokers\u2019 revenues, and making brokerage platforms less attractive to retail investors.\n\nThe rules would take the extraordinary step of centralizing the execution of retail investors\u2019 stock trades in what many expect to be slower, more complicated, and more expensive auctions run by quasi-governmental exchanges \u2013 just like the markets used to work (or not work) in 1975. Trust the government, they are here to help. Remember how well the Obamacare website worked?\n\nGensler\u2019s campaign against self-directed brokerage and retail investors is also evident in another set of extreme reforms Gensler is expected to roll out later this year that would crack down on the ability of brokers to communicate with their customers using so-called \"digital engagement practices.\"\n\nIn other words, this would ban the normal twenty-first century methods of communication used by countless businesses across a variety of industries including insurance, banking, retail and eCommerce, healthcare, travel and leisure, entertainment, and telecommunications.\n\nThe damage the SEC\u2019s overreaching rule proposals will do to the stock market and retail investors is likely to be extraordinary and long-lasting.\n\nIf Gensler gets his way, the stock market will be less competitive, slower, more confusing, and more expensive for Main Street investors. Brokers and other financial providers whose revenues will be trimmed or eliminated by the government will likely respond by passing costs along to customers and offering fewer innovative, low-cost products and services to the very customers who want them and need them the most, including millions of Americans who were previously shut out of the stock market.\n\nAt its core, Gensler \u2013 a hundred millionaire, 65-year-old former Goldman Sachs partner \u2013 appears to be motivated by the view that Main Street America simply isn\u2019t capable of choosing how they should invest their own money and that they need the government to protect them from themselves.\n\nIn the end, many investors may simply decide it\u2019s not worth the trouble or cost to invest and leave the market altogether \u2013 in other words, the SEC will redline them from participating in America\u2019s future. This would be a true American tragedy, and one that only big government could author.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the government went after Americans\u2019 brokerage accounts. In 2016, the Department of Labor embarked on its own campaign against brokers providing advice to retirement savers by subjecting the firms to a federal \"fiduciary duty\" to act in their clients\u2019 best interests.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nWhile it sounds pure and noble on its face, the backlash among investors and other market participants was swift and resounding. Critics like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce characterized the rule as a set of \"theoretical academic exercises\" and set forth data showing that the rule threatened to reduce \"access to advice for small retirement savers and small businesses.\"\n\nThe parallels to the SEC\u2019s current efforts to target brokers and their retail customers in the equities markets \u2013 from the virtue signaling used to justify the rules to the impacts on Main Street investors \u2013 are striking.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFortunately, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the Fiduciary Rule, finding that the Department of Labor \"exceeded its regulatory authority\" to promulgate a rule that was \"unreasonable.\" If Gensler\u2019s rules are adopted, the courts will again be the last line of defense against a paternalistic government agency seeking to substitute its own judgment for that of tens of millions of retail investors.\n\nEven with the recent market downturn, we are living in a golden age of retail investing. Gensler should stop meddling with the best markets in the world and stop trying to be retail investors\u2019 nanny.

My dad, who started the farm in 1953, worked his tail off growing corn, soybeans, wheat, and raising hogs. I saw a chance to expand, and while it\u2019s been a long slog, today we farm over 1,900 acres.\n\nBut now I\u2019m worried we can\u2019t keep expanding because of the heavy hand of the federal government. It\u2019s the most infuriating thing I\u2019ve ever encountered.\n\nThe Biden administration rolled out its long-awaited \"Waters of the United States\" rule just before the new year, the latest version of the regulation that won\u2019t die. It follows the Obama administration\u2019s attempt to claim enormous federal power over land like mine, simply because a small amount of water sometimes runs over it, as water is known to do.\n\nDROUGHT CONDITIONS TAKING A TOLL ON FARMERS' MENTAL HEALTH: 'FEEL LIKE YOU\u2019RE A FAILURE'\n\nThe Trump administration went the other direction, giving my farm a break and me some hope. Yet in the name of \"clean water,\" the Biden EPA is once again claiming control, the likes of which D.C. should never have over my property.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong: As a farmer, I\u2019m deeply committed to keeping my region\u2019s water clean and our environment healthy. It does me no good if northeast Indiana becomes so polluted that I can\u2019t grow crops or raise hogs. Unclean water is bad for business. That\u2019s why every neighbor I have and farmer I know supports the Clean Water Act. But what I don\u2019t support is twisting the law to the point that my property and my future are no longer my own.\n\nI\u2019m no lawyer, but when I read that the Clean Water Act gives D.C. power to regulate \"navigable waters\" it seems clear that we\u2019re talking about, you know, waters you can navigate. Of course, that includes the Eel River, which some of my farm backs up to. But there\u2019s no world in which anything else on my property fits the bill.\n\nI have some drainage ditches that occasionally fill up with runoff from the fields or rain from big storms, but they\u2019re not navigable unless we\u2019re talking toy boats that fit in the palm of my hand. Ditto the wetlands that dot the farm, remnants of when this region was called the \"Great Black Swamp.\" There\u2019s no way to navigate them, and they don\u2019t have an outlet. The water just seeps into the ground.\n\nI\u2019m now forced to ask myself if the EPA mandate applies to these areas, and the honest answer is: I don\u2019t know. The rule is so tough to understand that simply figuring out what I can do with my property is beyond my capability.\n\nWhat constitutes a \"material influence\" on bigger waters? What does it mean to \"significantly affect\" them? And what on earth is the \"nexus standard\"? The only way to get to the bottom of this is to hire expensive lawyers who can interpret every word, glance, and sneeze from D.C. bureaucrats, and then, if necessary, pay an expensive permit so I can actually use my land.

Democrats, including President Biden and governors across multiple states, have routinely celebrated new wind development while taking measures to restrict fossil fuel investment.\n\n\"Offshore oil and gas companies play a key role in the investing in, scaling, and deploying of low carbon solutions, including offshore wind,\" National Ocean Industries Association (NOIA) President Erik Milito told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"Removing or restricting investment opportunities for the offshore oil and gas sector would eliminate a key source of engineering expertise, not to mention R&D funding that can find, scale, and deploy the solutions to many of the technical challenges currently associated with decarbonization efforts,\" Milito continued. \"The future success of decarbonization efforts depends upon continued revenue generation from companies in the oil and gas sector.\"\n\n12 NJ MAYORS RAISE ALARM ON OFFSHORE WIND AFTER 'UNPRECEDENTED' NUMBER OF WHALE DEATHS\n\nNOIA, which is the largest trade group serving the offshore oil, gas and wind industries, has argued that a low carbon energy transition can only occur with the support of the oil and gas industry.\n\nThe group actively advocates for new fossil fuel and wind development in U.S. waters.

According to the company's most recent earnings report, just 14% of its revenue comes from its renewable business.\n\nThe 2,600-megawatt Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project slated to be constructed by 2026 off the coast of southeastern Virginia is owned by Dominion Energy. Renewable power represents a small slice of the billion-dollar power company's business which mainly consists of natural gas sales and fossil fuel-powered electricity sales.\n\nSouthCoast Wind, the 2,400-megawatt project slated for 2028 and located 30 miles south of Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Massachusetts, is being developed by oil company Shell and Ocean Winds, a joint venture between two European utility companies EDP Group and ENGIE.

Documents filed with the Connecticut state government shows that AC Aviation is a subsidiary of the New York City hedge fund AC Investment Management which specializes in renewable energy and clean technology investments and manages funds worth hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nFAA filings suggest that the plane was transferred from Flying Squirrel to AC Aviation on Aug. 22.

In 2019, he told Icelandic reporter J\u00f3hann Bjarni Kolbeinsson that he has to \"fly to meet with people and get things done,\" that he had devoted his life to fighting climate change and that he offsets his carbon consumption.\n\nPrivate jet travel, which is by far the most carbon-intensive mode of transportation, emits 10 times more carbon than commercial planes and 50 times more carbon than trains, according to a 2021 report from the group Transport & Environment.\n\n\"The problem with folks like John Kerry and the climate hypocrites who run the green movement is that they want to use the coercive power of government,\" Daniel Turner, the executive director of Power The Future, told Fox News Digital in an interview in July. \"They want to use the power of government to deny the rest of us the ability to use those fossil fuels that they take for granted.\"\n\nIn his role as special presidential envoy for climate, Kerry travels around the world, attending high-profile climate summits and diplomatic engagements in an effort to push a global transition from fossil fuels to green energy alternatives.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn addition to Turner, Kerry was also blasted by Republican lawmakers, some of whom have opened inquiries into his use of private jets to travel.\n\n\"The Biden administration is wildly out of touch with every day Americans,\" Sen.

Simultaneously, state officials are pushing an electrification of the economy, particularly in the transportation sector through electric vehicle mandates, which is expected to increase pressure on the grid.\n\n\"California is drastically cutting our dependence on fossil fuels and cleaning our air,\" Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a November announcement unveiling the \"world\u2019s first detailed pathway to carbon neutrality.\"\n\nThe state's plan involves goals to slash greenhouse gas emissions by 85%, cut oil usage by 94% and deploy more solar and wind capacity over the next two decades. The aggressive plan to overhaul the state's energy system came three months after a top California environmental agency moved forward with a rule requiring all new vehicle sales to be electric by 2035.\n\nGAVIN NEWSOM'S 2024 CHANCES COULD BE THREATENED BY CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY GRID STRUGGLES\n\nIn 2021, the most recent year with data, wind and solar accounted for about 25% of total electricity generated in California while natural gas accounted for more than 50% of in-state electricity generation. And 19% of new car sales in California were zero-emission vehicles, state data showed.\n\nExperts told Fox News Digital environmental mandates implemented by Newsom and his administration have already created instability in the grid, an issue they argued would only get worse as existing fossil fuel power generation capacity was taken offline and replaced by intermittent sources.\n\n\"They're going to have to build an outrageous amount of wind and solar in a very short time if they want to accomplish their objectives of electrifying \u2014 our whole transportation sector and our whole home heating and cooling and residential sector,\" Edward Ring, a senior fellow with and co-founder of the California Policy Center, told Fox News Digital in an interview.\n\n\"There's a burden to the consumer that's going to get very heavy,\" he continued. \"Even if they can pull it off without blackouts, the burden to the consumer is going to be ridiculous.\"\n\nEXPERTS BLAME GREEN ENERGY POLICIES FOR EUROPE'S FULL-SCALE ENERGY CRISIS: 'A WARNING TO THE US'\n\nOver summer, the California Independent System Operator (CAISO), the state's electric grid operator, repeatedly warned that high demand would significantly strain utility providers' ability to supply consumers electricity amid a heat wave.\n\nCAISO issued an \"energy emergency alert 3,\" its highest alert level, at one point in early September, saying residents should maximize conservation and expect rotating outages, and a flex alert for more than seven consecutive days. The operator also recommended residents refrain from charging electric vehicles to reduce stress on the grid.\n\n\"They already are suffering,\" said Myron Ebell, the director of the Competitive Enterprise Institute's Center for Energy and Environment.\n\n\"They're, in fact, telling people that they're going to start shutting off natural gas to houses and that they have to convert to electricity,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"Then, they're forcing people to buy electric vehicles and they're going to stop selling internal combustion engine vehicles. That will add to the grid's demand.\"\n\nIn its annual report released in December, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), a nonpartisan grid watchdog, stated that California faced a \"high risk of energy or capacity shortfall\" in coming years, particularly during summer months, as a result of traditional power plant retirements and increased demand.\n\nCALIFORNIA URGES RESIDENTS AGAIN NOT TO CHARGE EVS ON BUSY TRAVEL WEEKEND\n\nEbell added that the intermittent nature of solar and wind, meaning they produce less power relative to their total generation capacity, could create instability. Green energy developers and government officials often highlight total capacity of new renewable power projects, but fail to mention how much actual power the project is expected to produce.\n\nSolar panels, for example, produce just 25% and wind turbines produce 34% of their listed capacity, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Coal, natural gas and nuclear power plants, meanwhile produce 49%, 54% and 93% of their listed capacity, respectively.\n\n\"The only way the electrification of the transportation sector and of home heating and cooling can work is if the utility sector continues to build natural gas fired plants and looks to building nuclear plants and perhaps building new coal plants because the grid in these states that are pushing these policies is already overloaded,\" Ebell continued.\n\n\"As everybody moves to EVs, if it happens, the only way to do it is to find more baseload power and dispatchable power.\"\n\nBIDEN'S ENERGY SECRETARY SAYS SHE SUPPORTS CALIFORNIA GAS VEHICLE BAN\n\nThe total capacity of the state's natural gas power plants has fallen 15% between 2013 and 2021, according to the California Energy Commission. In April, Newsom was forced to reverse course on plans to allow California's only remaining nuclear plant, which alone produces 9% of the state's electricity generation, to close.\n\nCalifornia also imports more electricity than any other state in the U.S., receiving between 20%-30% of its supplies from mainly fossil fuels out-of-state, EIA data shows.\n\nAnother potential hurdle to the future of California's grid stability is the need for new transmission line infrastructure to handle additional demand and connect new renewable energy projects, often located in rural regions, to the grid, Steven Malanga, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, told Fox News Digital. He also argued leaders should put greater emphasis on battery storage which remains far behind where it needs to be.\n\n\"These are tremendous costs which haven't been fairly calculated by the renewable energy people,\" Malanga said in an interview. \"Essentially what happens is we have this power grid that has been built up over the decades and to go renewable doesn't just involve building renewable like wind farms and solar farms, but you also have to build new transmission lines.\"\n\n\"And more significantly, you have to build storage capacity,\" he continued. \"In a lot of places like California, they're not even backing up renewables with natural gas, which is really what most sensible people, utility people, say you have to do because renewables are intermittent.\"\n\nVIRGINIA DEMOCRATS FORCE STATE TO ADOPT CALIFORNIA'S CRACKDOWN ON GAS CARS\n\nThe Department of Energy estimated last year that the U.S. would need to expand its transmission infrastructure 60% by 2030 and triple its size by 2050 to meet climate goals.\n\nAccording to an independent analysis by energy researcher Robert Bryce, at its current pace, it would take an estimated 282 years to triple the nation's transmission capacity. Like other energy projects and infrastructure development, transmission lines often face delays from environmental regulation and local opposition.\n\n\"You have to get that power to cities which are the big users of electricity,\" Malanga told Fox News Digital. \"So, you have to build all new transmission lines. Transmission lines are not only expensive to build, but they face tremendous environmental regulations. Permitting them takes years.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"It takes ten years just to get approvals to build some of these transmission lines and that's just one generation,\" he added. \"Some of these places have renewable targets that are 2035, 2040 and 2045. That's not that's far in the future if you're talking about building a whole new energy infrastructure, which is essentially what we're talking about in California.\"\n\n\"The truth of the matter is that in many places we've seen how the energy grid is already dangerously close to failing because we're not paying enough attention to sustaining the grid. This is going to result in blackouts. And we've already seen them. The stories are tragic.\""}, {"title": "DeSantis's Florida beats Newsom's California, again.

Yet, the stringency and duration of government measures varied considerably across the U.S.\n\nA new Paragon Health Institute study we coauthored confirms what many long suspected: more severe lockdowns did not significantly improve health outcomes but led to much worse economic and education outcomes. States that eschewed federal proclamations tended to do far better than states that adopted severe measures, like closing businesses and schools.\n\nUnder our constitutional system of government, public health decisions are generally reserved to the states. The different approaches each state took to deciding which measures to impose and for how long created a natural experiment.\n\nWe compared a quantitative index created by Oxford University of government measures taken to combat COVID-19 \u2013 including workplace and school closures, public event cancellations, stay-at-home requirements, and masking policies \u2013 to health, economic and educational outcomes across states. States with more severe government interventions did not have better health outcomes, as measured by COVID deaths (adjusted for age and pre-existing conditions) and all-cause excess mortality than less restrictive states.\n\nNYC MAYOR SAYS COVID MANDATES MAY NEED TO RETURN, BLASTS PEOPLE WHO SAY \u2018I WANT TO DO WHATEVER I WANT\u2019\n\nStates with more stringent lockdowns, though, had much worse economic outcomes (increased unemployment and decreased GDP) and much worse education outcomes (less in-person schooling). Other studies show severe learning deficits associated with the loss of in-person education, and that the economic and educational impacts of lockdowns disproportionately affected lower-income families.\n\nThe severity of government pandemic measures also influenced people\u2019s decisions about where to live. Census data on domestic migration revealed that annual average movement between states increased 44% in the pandemic period (July 1, 2020, to June 30, 2022) compared with the five-year pre-pandemic average.\n\nA significant correlation between states\u2019 degree of lockdowns and out-migration, suggests that people voted with their feet, leaving states with more severe restrictions and moving to states with less severe measures\n\nStates\u2019 COVID response performances were starkly illustrated by comparing the divergent approaches of two of the nation\u2019s largest states \u2013 California and Florida. California imposed severe and prolonged lockdowns. Florida relaxed general lockdowns after a short time and focused protection measures on the vulnerable elderly. These policies were noteworthy since COVID infection mortality rates were known to be much higher for the elderly. Florida has one of the oldest populations and California one of the youngest.\n\nIN LATEST BLOW TO SCHOOL CLOSURES, STUDY FINDS KIDS OVER 100 TIMES LESS LIKELY TO DIE FROM COVID THAN ADULTS\n\nThe two states had roughly equal health outcomes scores, suggesting little, if any, health benefit from California\u2019s severe approach. But California suffered far worse economic and education outcomes than average while Florida\u2019s outcomes were well above average.\n\nPrior to the pandemic, California and Florida led the nation in annual out and in-migration respectively. But the numbers jumped during the pandemic. California\u2019s annual out-migration surged 154% in the pandemic years over pre-pandemic averages as people fled severe lockdowns. Florida\u2019s open schools and businesses boosted in-migration by nearly 60%. One of us (Blase) moved his family from Virginia to Florida in early 2021, mainly so his kids could resume in-person schooling and a normal life.\n\nPrior to COVID-19, the World Health Organization and most countries\u2019 health agencies had rejected lockdowns as a legitimate strategy for pandemics. What accounts for the disastrous policy shift during COVID?\n\nPolicymakers stubbornly relied on flawed modeling that over-predicted deaths and that over-estimated lockdown benefits. Influential modelers such as Imperial College London consciously failed to account for peoples\u2019 voluntary risk avoidance behaviors that limit the benefit of government restrictions. They utilized inflated COVID infection mortality and transmission rates. Relying on their inflated estimates, the modelers recommended imposing lockdown measures until a vaccine became available.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nIn addition, public health officials refused to consider, much less balance, the economic and educational consequences, and excess non-COVID mortality that lockdowns would cause. Federal officials were fixated on direct COVID health effects and state officials who considered other outcomes were unfairly vilified.\n\nFuture pandemics \u2013 whether from variants of known viruses or yet unknown organisms \u2013 are inevitable. Policymakers must avoid severe, prolonged, and one-size-fits-all restrictions and be prepared to balance the benefits of their responses against the economic, educational, health and social costs. They need to recognize that individuals\u2019 choices \u2013 to undertake voluntary risk mitigation, comply with government measures, or move to states whose policies better reflect their cost-benefit calculations \u2013 are the decisive determinants of pandemic outcomes.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBrian Blase, who served as a special assistant to President Trump at the National Economic Council, is president of Paragon.

Things have gotten nasty and digital staffers from NBC News held signs declaring the network stands for \"Nothing But Criminals\" outside the iconic Rockefeller Center.\n\nThe labor issues surfaced only a few weeks after a significant leadership change inside the newsroom, as controversial now-former president Noah Oppenheim was replaced by Rebecca Blumenstein, who came to NBC from The New York Times.\n\nBut while Oppenheim was president of NBC News, Blumenstein has the title of president of editorial. The subtle difference indicates that NBCUniversal News Group Chairman Cesar Conde \u2013 who is seen as a businessman, not a journalist \u2013 has more control than ever.\n\nThe leadership change and labor beef came in the wake of NBC News refusing to explain why it mysteriously retracted Miguel Almaguer\u2019s Paul Pelosi report.

The following Monday, ABC News president Kim Godwin did an about-face and pulled Holmes and Robach off the air, claiming the \"distraction\" had become too significant. The made-for-tabloids scandal generated an onslaught of bad publicity as paparazzi chronicled every step Robach and Holmes made during a bizarre eight-week probe into their relationship.\n\nHolmes has since been accused of other affairs with multiple former ABC News employees.

Meek abruptly resigned from the Disney-owned network following an FBI raid of his Arlington, Virginia, home last year. The sudden resignation of Meek, who regularly worked on sensitive stories while working as a national-security investigative producer for ABC News, baffled media insiders who thought the raid could have been tied to his work.\n\nThe Justice Department issued a press release that finally shed light on the mysterious raid of the journalist's home. Meek is charged with transportation of child pornography and faces a mandatory minimum of five years in prison and a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison if convicted.

It applies to all parts of the executive branch: the FBI, DHS, White House, or any other acronym agency.

Gavin Newsom called a special legislative session in December to tax California\u2019s oil refiners out of their \"excessive\" profits, he was following a well-trod path of Golden State governors blaming the oil and gas industry for the state\u2019s high energy prices.\n\nNewsom should look in a mirror to see the reason for high energy prices.\n\nCalifornia typically has the highest gasoline prices in the contiguous United States \u2014 an artifact of three things:\n\nCHINA THREATENING US SOLAR AMBITIONS\n\nPersistent air quality issues that demand a special gasoline formulation;\n\nThe highest fuel taxes in America \u2014 including an array of \"fees\" such as a \"cap-and-trade\";\n\nAnd an isolated fuel market due to the special formulation that results in no refinery slack so that when a plant has an accident or goes down for maintenance, prices can quickly soar.\n\nToday, gasoline in California goes for $4.62 per gallon, of which about 90 cents are state taxes and fees and 18.4 cents federal.\n\nHigh prices for gasoline \u2014 along with the pressing need to save the planet by reducing carbon emissions to \"net zero\" \u2014 are cited by Newsom as the rationale for cutting oil consumption by 94% by 2045. Part of this plan involves banning the use of natural gas in homes and apartments for furnaces, water heaters and stoves.\n\nGiven the outsized influence that California\u2019s often groundbreaking policies can have on the rest of the nation, it\u2019s worthwhile to look at how California has done on its energy policies as well as some of the challenges that lie ahead.\n\nIn the early 2000s, before new hydraulic fracturing (fracking) techniques transformed America\u2019s oil and gas industry, experts forecast that the Pacific Coast from Vancouver, British Columbia to Tijuana, Mexico, would need some nine costly liquified natural gas terminals to import enough fuel to keep the lights on. Going big on solar and wind power, it was reasoned, would end up saving California consumers billions of dollars while keeping the grid up.\n\nIn 2001, California residential electricity customers were paying 41% more than the national average and 36% more than their Texas counterparts. As fracking drove the price of natural gas down through 2010, California\u2019s residential customers paid 28% more than the U.S. average and 27% more than did Texans (natural gas generates most of California\u2019s electricity). But in the first 11 months of 2022, California electricity prices soared to the highest in the Lower 48 \u2014 and higher than Alaska, too \u2014 so that now California families are paying 74% more than the national average and almost double (96%) more than do Texans.\n\nThat means that the average California household is paying about $814 more per year for electricity than what they\u2019d be paying if electricity in California was priced at the national average. And even though the average Texan uses almost twice as much electricity to heat and cool their homes as do Californians with their mild climate, Texans pay about $85 less per household for electricity than Californians.\n\nCalifornia charges a cap-and-trade fee on energy producers. Consumers pay this fee in the form of higher energy costs. But voters are complaining of higher energy costs, so the state is about to dole out $1.3 billion in \"relief\" to the customers they took the money from in the first place.\n\nThis is a remarkable turn of events for a state with a grid that\u2019s now producing 25% of the power generated in-state from wind and solar \u2014 it\u2019s almost as if all those made-in-China solar panels, wind turbines and batteries turned out to be quite expensive.\n\nMight things get more expensive in California with the redoubled push to decarbonize?\n\n\n\nCalifornia charges a cap-and-trade fee on energy producers.

This will require an additional 4% of power from California\u2019s electric grid, meaning increasing wind power by about 50% or solar power by another 25% \u2014 plus supporting battery farms to ensure the grid stays energized when it\u2019s neither windy nor sunny.\n\nBut converting to EVs from internal combustion engines is child\u2019s play compared to phasing out the use of natural gas in homes. To replace home natural gas use with electricity would require about another 119,200 gigawatt hours (GWh) of generation. By comparison, in 2021, California generated 194,127 GWh in state and imported another 83,637 GWh of electricity \u2014 the most electricity imported by any state (California is content to export its energy pollution).\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nReplacing residential natural gas and natural gas power generators in California requires the state to boost its solar and wind generation by almost 4-1/2 times.

The company said the weld was for a fitting that connected two sections of pipe, and the fitting and weld came from a manufacturing plant.\n\nThe company, which is responsible for overseeing inspections of its pipeline system, said it still is investigating the cause of the pipeline stress and is analyzing \"other areas with potentially similar conditions.\" The Dec. 7 rupture spilled nearly 13,000 barrels of crude oil, with each barrel containing 42 gallons, the size of a standard household bathtub.\n\nNORTHEASTERN KANSAS OIL SPILL SHUTS DOWN KEYSTONE PIPELINE\n\n\"Our focus continues to be the safe operation of the pipeline system,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nNo one was evacuated following the spill, and officials said it did not affect the two larger rivers and reservoir downstream.

Ned Lamont on Wednesday proposed the state's first income tax reduction in nearly 30 years and its largest ever.\n\nLamont said the state's fiscal health is now the strongest it's been in decades, enabling officials to finally focus on addressing Connecticut's nagging reputation of being a high-cost state.\n\n\"For the first time in over a generation, Connecticut has enjoyed strong economic and population growth,\" he told a joint session of the Democratic-controlled General Assembly. \"And more taxpayers, a growing economy, coupled with our shared fiscal discipline, has resulted in four consecutive balanced budgets, soon to be five.\"\n\nCONNECTICUT GOV. LAMONT PROPOSES STATE'S 1ST TAX CUT IN NEARLY 30 YEARS\n\nLamont's two-year, $50.5 billion budget plan, which still needs legislative approval and faces some pushback from liberals in his party who support raising taxes on the wealthy, would reduce personal income tax rates.\n\nFamilies, for example, would see their tax rate of 3% on the first $20,000 of earned income and 5% percent of income up to $100,000 a year drop to 2% and 4.5%, respectively. That's in addition to Lamont's proposal to increase the earned income tax credit, ensuring families making less than $50,000 will pay no state income tax. More than 200,000 low-income workers are eligible for the credit\n\nCombined, the two proposals are predicted to save low- and middle-income taxpayers nearly $500 million a year.\n\nLamont also called for increasing funding for affordable housing, childcare programs and local education and canceling overdue medical debt for thousands of residents. And he proposed fully restoring a tax credit that helps business owners avoid a $10,000 federal cap on state and local tax deductions, as well as expanding a tax credit for corporations that provide job training, childcare subsidies, tuition reimbursement and other services to their employees.\n\nRepublicans, who welcomed Lamont's willingness to cut taxes, say it's time to start giving back to taxpayers, especially considering the current fiscal year is expected to end with a $1.3 billion surplus.\n\n\"I think there's still a real affordability issue in the state of Connecticut,\" House Minority Leader Vincent Candelora said. \"So while government has been working well for itself, the residents don't feel that way.\"\n\nCONNECTICUT GOV.

Malloy's budget director, Ben Barnes, warned that the state was in \"a period of permanent fiscal crisis.\"\n\nAt that time, Connecticut had experienced multiple years of projected budget deficits and massive unfunded state pension liabilities, forcing Malloy to raise taxes, lay off state employees and cut programs to balance the books.\n\nLamont and state legislators credit a package of bipartisan fiscal \"guardrails\" imposed in 2017 for leading to billions of dollars in surpluses in recent years. Those budget controls, which the General Assembly is expected to renew on Thursday, include caps on spending and revenues, including potentially volatile stock market earnings that Connecticut has traditionally relied on heavily.\n\nDespite those reforms, Connecticut still faces challenges, including roughly $88 billion in unfunded pension liability and debt.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I think there\u2019s a lot of room for optimism.

At 80, he lacks the clarity and energy to persuade and inspire a citizenry that tells pollsters they disapprove of his handling of key issues that keep them up at night and don't want him to run for a second term. Tuesday night did little to change that, and exposed the political, cultural and policy cleavages of a nation he promised to unify.\n\nForget Democrat spin about what a great orator Biden, who is not a great orator, was Tuesday night. Instead, listen to the people: 58% of Americans believe the state of the union is not strong, 62% say Biden his done nothing or precious little to beat back inflation, avoid recession, contain China or remove the welcome mat from the porous southern border.\n\nHis messages are less compelling given that as a messenger (and as commander-in-chief) Biden is viewed as dishonest, incompetent, mentally unfit for the job, unable to manage a crisis and divisive.\n\nBIDEN REPEATS MISLEADING JOBS CLAIM IN STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS\n\nBiden audaciously addressed issues in his State of the Union that he has ignored throughout his presidency, e.g., fentanyl, now the number one killer of 18-44-year-olds in the U.S.; kids under 14 are dying from fentanyl faster than any other age group. He also stumbled and bumbled his way into picking fights and prevaricating about on Medicare and Social Security and oil and gas that caused him to cede the spotlight and lose command of the room.\n\nBiden\u2019s causal relationship with the truth was on full display, along with his communication deficits that are causing Democrats to openly criticize him and search for 2024 alternatives.\n\nIt was great to see House Speaker Republican Kevin McCarthy in the seat where Nancy Pelosi sat for too long. He was dignified and restrained, without the eye rolling, lips-pursing bizarre conduct and raw partisanship, the low point of which was Pelosi tearing up a hard copy of President Donald Trump\u2019s State of the Union speech and with it, tearing up mention on those pages and recognition in the chamber the last surviving Tuskegee Airman, the survival of a child born at 21 weeks and the mourning families of Rocky Jones and Kayla Mueller.\n\nWhat didn\u2019t look different is Biden. He is starting year three how he has started every other year of his presidency, by trying to convince the American people to believe what he says, not what they see, when it comes to the economy, the southern border, public safety, foreign policy and energy policy. Biden doubled down on this strategy last night in his State of the Union.\n\nBiden falsely bragged about his \"record\" job creation and his infrastructure bill, claims the public soundly rejects in recent polling. Sixty percent don\u2019t think Biden created \"more good jobs\" in their community and don\u2019t think he \"has improved roads and bridges\" in their community.\n\nDespite Biden hailing his economy, this week a record 41% said they are \"not as well-off financially\" since Biden became president, which is the highest on record since the measurement began in 1986. Furthermore, a February 1, Fox News poll showed that 56% say inflation is \"not under control at all\" and 74% think we are likely headed into a recession this year. The public\u2019s raw economic perception has become the president\u2019s rude political reality.\n\nAs Biden seeks reelection, it comes as no surprise that he is trying to fool voters he is pivoting to the center. While plenty of his speech was meant to reassure the progressive left, Biden rediscovered his Inauguration Day pledge to unify the country and work across the aisle in his State of the Union address, but fleetingly and unconvincingly. Much like his bizarre, devil of a speech in Philadelphia a few months ago, Biden took pot shots at the 74 million men and women who voted against him.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThe Democrat party is stuck. No single speech will solve that. They are saddled with an unpopular president and even more unpopular vice president in Kamala Harris who, according to the Washington Post, has Democrats worried about her political prospects and per the New York Times, even her allies have said, \"she had not risen to the challenge of proving herself as a future leader of the party, much less the country.\"\n\nThe state of our union is shaky. Partisan hooting and hollering aside, Biden is having a terrible 2023. Poor poll numbers, a growing scandalabra about mishandling of classified documents, his slow response to the Chinese spy balloon, and a Republican Congress poised to hold this administration accountable for policy blunders, reckless spending and feckless leadership. Republicans must reclaim the mantle of fiscal responsibility and sanity.\n\nArkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders, half Biden\u2019s age and with twice his communications skills, offered a crisp, contrasting choice and vision for America in the Republican rebuttal.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAs Sanders said, \"Republicans believe in an America where strong families thrive is safe communities; where jobs are abundant and paychecks are rising; where the freedom our veterans shed their blood to defend is the birthright of every man, woman and child.\"\n\nRepublican elected officials must remind voters that the Republican Party stands for freedom, fairness, security, life, liberty, opportunity and prosperity and take on Biden and the rest of the Democrats.

They also argued that any emissions they produce would be offset from either their use of clean energy in different areas of their lives or their green business ventures.\n\n\"Well, I, by the gold standard of, funding Climeworks, to do direct air capture that far exceeds my family's carbon footprint,\" Gates told BBC last week when asked about how he frequently travels on private planes.\n\n\"I'm comfortable with the idea that not only am I not part of the problem by paying for the offsets, but also through the billions that my Breakthrough Energy group is spending, that I am part of the solution,\" he continued.\n\nJOHN KERRY'S SECRET CCP NEGOTIATIONS PROBED BY GOP OVERSIGHT CHAIRMAN\n\nClimeworks is a European firm that specializes in carbon capture technology which removes emissions from the atmosphere. Last year, the company announced it had signed a 10-year deal with Microsoft to become the software corporation's first supplier of long-term, technology-based carbon removal.\n\nGates has given millions of dollars to various carbon removal and climate technology companies through Breakthrough Energy, his organization that invests in sustainable innovation projects. Gates Ventures is also one of several funding partners of ClimateWorks, a non-profit organization that works to advance climate solutions and technology around the world.\n\nHowever, Gates and other global climate activists like Kerry have been repeatedly criticized for their use of private jets to travel the world. Private jet travel, which is by far the most carbon-intensive mode of transportation, emits 10 times more carbon than commercial planes and 50 times more carbon than trains, according to a 2021 report from the group Transport & Environment.\n\nJOHN KERRY'S OFFICE CONSULTED LEFT-WING ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS WHILE CRAFTING POLICIES, EMAILS SHOW\n\n\"If you offset your carbon, it\u2019s the only choice for somebody like me, who is traveling the world to win this battle,\" Kerry told Icelandic reporter J\u00f3hann Bjarni Kolbeinsson in 2019. \"I\u2019ve been involved in this fight for years.\"\n\n\"I believe the time it takes me to get somewhere, I can\u2019t sail across the ocean, I have to fly to meet with people and get things done,\" he added. \"But what I\u2019m doing almost full-time is working to win the battle of climate change. And in the end, if I offset and contribute my life to do this, I\u2019m not going to be put on the defensive.\"\n\nKerry's comments were made after he traveled to Iceland using a private jet to accept an environmental award.\n\nIt is unclear how Kerry has offset his private jet emissions. Since President Biden appointed him to be his climate czar in January 2021, Kerry's family jet has emitted more than 300 metric tons, Fox News Digital previously reported.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn response to criticism, Kerry has recently opted to fly on commercial airlines when traveling on official business.\n\n\"Obviously, [Gates and Kerry are] hypocritical and, quite frankly, insulting.

that mask will diminish their attractiveness, and hence less likely to wear face masks,\" Choi added.\n\nPeople were questioned whether they would wear a mask during a job interview.\n\n\"It is worth noting that mask attractiveness belief was related to mask-wearing intention to a similar degree of COVID-19 fear in study 1,\" the authors added in the report.\n\n\"Therefore, our results demonstrate

The State of the Union address will also allow the president to make an early pitch for re-election, should he decide to run again in 2024.\n\nHowever, that too may be a tough pitch \u2014 even among his own base.\n\nIndeed, a striking 62% of Democrats don't want Biden to run for re-election, compared to just 37% who want to see him seek a second term, according to a new Associated Press/NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe new survey came one day after the ABC News/Washington Post poll found that by a 58-31% margin, Democrats want their party to nominate someone other than Biden to be their 2024 presidential nominee.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment."}, {"title": "Nevada rancher warns inflation isn\u2019t over: Americans should prepare to pay more for groceries", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/media/nevada-rancher-warns-inflation-americans-prepare-pay-more-groceries", "tag": "MEDIA", "content": "A Nevada rancher has warned Americans that the price of groceries \u2013 including beef \u2013 is likely to continue to rise, citing inflation and a lower supply of cattle.\n\nJ.J.

His approval rating remains lower than every recent president excluding former President Donald Trump whose rating sat at 41% at this point in his presidency.\n\nMILITARY EXPERTS PROVIDE FRANK ASSESSMENT OF US SHORTCOMINGS IN POTENTIAL CHINA CONFLICT\n\n\"If President Biden is looking for an opportunity to alter a mostly static approval rating, the State of the Union, is his next best chance,\" Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion, told Fox News Digital last week. \"Biden needs to flip public sentiment about the strength of the union and find middle ground to offset many Americans who view the political parties as extreme.\"\n\nThe most recent crisis to hit the White House has been the revelation that a Chinese spy balloon was flying across the U.S., gathering intelligence on strategic sites throughout the Midwest. On Saturday, seven days after the balloon was first discovered by defense officials off the western coast of Alaska and two days after Pentagon publicly acknowledged it, a U.S. military fighter jet shot the balloon out of the sky over the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nPENTAGON WORKING TO RECOVER CHINESE SPY BALLOON, EXPECTS VALUABLE INTEL FROM IT\n\nWhile Biden and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin explained the delayed response was to protect Americans who may have been harmed were the balloon to fall on land, Republican lawmakers blasted the administration for being too weak. One GOP congressman said the incident was enough to warrant Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris to resign.\n\n\"The catastrophic Chinese Spy Balloon spectacle clearly threatened American families from Alaska to my home community in South Carolina and confirms President Biden and Vice President Harris should resign,\" said Rep. Joe Wilson, R-S.C., a member of the House Armed Services Committee.\n\nThe president has also been heavily criticized for a scandal revolving around how he mishandled classified documents from his tenure in the Obama administration. Over the course of the last several weeks, multiple batches of classified documents, some of which were marked \"top secret,\" have been found at various locations belonging to Biden including the Penn Biden Center, his foreign policy think tank, and the garage in his Wilmington, Delaware, residence.\n\nBIDEN CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS: 57% OF AMERICANS DISAPPROVE OF WHITE HOUSE HANDLING, AS STONEWALLING CONTINUES\n\nThe White House has stated that it has been transparent about the search for documents, but critics have accused Biden of purposely staying quiet on the scandal until after the 2022 midterm election to blunt the political impact of the scandal. Some classified documents were found shortly before the November election by the president's lawyers.\n\nIn addition, the border crisis over the last year has sparked calls for Biden to take more aggressive action on immigration and some Republicans have supported moving forward with a resolution to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.\n\n\"The Department of Homeland Security states the purpose of the Secretary is to 'secure and manage our borders.' You have failed to do this job. Additionally, you have shown a complete ineptitude or unwillingness to fix the problems your policies have created,\" a group of 11 Republican lawmakers from Texas wrote to Mayorkas last month.\n\nAccording to the Customs and Border Protection, migrant encounters in December surpassed 250,000 for the first time on record. In addition, about 300,000 illegal immigrants evaded border agents in less than four months compared to the 600,000 reported last year and border encounters have already hit a record high in fiscal year 2023.\n\nThe Biden administration has also grappled with a baby formula shortage that has wreaked chaos on parents across the country. In mid-February 2022, baby formula maker Abbott Nutrition shut down its production plant in Michigan, leading to a shortage in the ensuing months that has stretched to 2023.\n\n\"Well, here\u2019s the deal. I became aware of this problem some time in \u2014 after April \u2014 in early April, about how intense it was,\" Biden said in June. \"And so, we did everything in our power from that point on, and that\u2019s all I can tell you right now. And we\u2019re going to continue to do it until we get the job done.\"\n\nPARENTS SEARCH FRANTICALLY FOR HOMEMADE BABY FORMULA RECIPES AMID SHORTAGE\n\nAfter receiving criticism about his administration's response to the crisis, which led to empty shelves in stores nationwide, Biden ordered various agencies to devote resources to addressing the supply chain issues and the White House unveiled \"Operation Fly Formula\" as part of the effort. Since then dozens of \"formula missions\" have been conducted transporting millions of formula bottles to the U.S. from overseas.\n\nAnd inflation has remained a key concern of Americans since Biden's last State of the Union speech. In June, months after the address, inflation surged 9.1% year-over-year, the fastest uptick of its kind since 1981.\n\nRising consumer prices have impacted nearly every aspect of Americans' lives from energy and food to shelter, apparel and everyday goods. While inflation has fallen below 7%, it remains far higher than government targets and the Federal Reserve has continued tightening interest rates which could have negative reverberations throughout the U.S. economy.\n\nEnergy prices like heating and gasoline costs have particularly put strain on American families. Pump prices increased past $5 per gallon in mid-June, hitting their highest level ever recorded before falling again, but currently remain 46% higher than when Biden took office.\n\nPart of the pressure on energy costs have come as a result of Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, another crisis Biden has been faced with. Biden has repeatedly stood alongside other Western nations in supporting Ukraine, sending the war-torn country tens of billions of dollars in military aid over the past nearly 12 months.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Through every single step of this horrific war, the American people have been strong and unwavering in their support,\" Biden said in remarks on Jan. 25.\n\n\"And Democrats and Republicans in Congress have stood together,\" he said. \"The United States has worked in lockstep with our Allies and partners around the world to make sure the Ukrainian people are in the strongest possible position to defend their nation, their families, and against the brutal \u2014 the truly brutal aggression of Russia. We haven\u2019t seen the likes of this in a long time.\"\n\nExperts, though, have forecasted the conflict will continue to rage throughout 2023 which may be the bloodiest year of the war, likely forcing the president to make additional decisions on how much support he will offer Ukraine.\n\nBiden is scheduled to deliver his next State of the Union address on Feb. 7."}, {"title": "At State of the Union, Biden has 3 big failures he must own when he addresses nation", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/state-union-biden-has-3-big-failures-he-must-own-when-he-addresses-nation", "tag": "OPINION", "content": "NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n\nPresident Joe Biden will deliver the annual State of the Union address Tuesday night. All three branches of government \u2014 and plenty of television cameras \u2014 will be on hand for one of our nation\u2019s most hallowed traditions.\n\nThe president is likely to subject the nation to his usual misleading explanations of his administration\u2019s many failures. Sadly, at every stage of his term in office, Biden has bragged, boasted and tried to shift blame. Biden called inflation \"transitory\" and his surrender to the Taliban \"an extraordinary success.\" There has been no presidential failure \u2014 no matter how embarrassing or how destructive \u2014 that he has not called a victory.\n\nThe American people see right through it. They see the cost of inflation every time they go to the grocery store. They see the shocking toll of the fentanyl crisis and crime every time they turn on the evening news. The American people do not want more cheap talking points. We want real solutions that will make a difference in people\u2019s lives.\n\nCHINESE SPY BALLOON OVER CENTRAL US, WILL BE IN US AIRSPACE FOR 'A FEW DAYS,' PENTAGON SAYS\n\nNo matter what Biden says Tuesday night, here\u2019s the reality.\n\nDemocrats had complete control of Washington for two years. In those two years alone, they added $3 trillion in government spending. They caused the national debt to balloon to $31 trillion \u2014 larger than our entire economy. Under Biden we have seen the worst inflation in 40 years, the worst energy crisis in 40 years, and the worst border crisis in American history.\n\nThe American people are focused on three issues right now, and they are the three biggest failures that Biden doesn\u2019t want to discuss.\n\n1. Biden's inflation crisis\n\nThe first is inflation. Under Biden prices have risen by a total of more than 13%. As a result, the American people have effectively lost one out of every eight dollars in their pockets and in their savings accounts. A recent study shows the average family has lost more than $10,000 to higher prices just since Joe Biden took office.\n\n2. Biden's energy crisis\n\nInflation is largely being driven by the second major Biden crisis \u2014 and that is his war on American energy. Since the day Biden took office, he has put a stranglehold on American energy production.\n\nThe U.S. is now producing 2 million fewer barrels per day of oil less than we should be. As a result, the cost of heating oil is up by two-thirds, the price of natural gas is up by half, and electricity is up by more than 20 cents on the dollar. These prices are adding up, and more than 20 million American households have now fallen behind on their utility bills.\n\n3. Biden's border crisis\n\nThe third major issue of our time is the crisis at the southern border. It is the worst in history. On Biden\u2019s first day in office, he stopped all deportations, stopped building the wall, and ended the Remain in Mexico policy. Ever since then, our southern border has been a 2,000-mile gaping wound. More than four and a half million illegal immigrants have been caught crossing the border since Joe Biden took office. Border patrol agents have also seized enough drugs to kill every man, woman, and child in this country.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nBiden doesn\u2019t want to talk about any of these crises Tuesday night, and especially not his role in creating them. Yet he can\u2019t run from them. These are the top issues facing the American people every day, and all of them were created by the president and his Democrat allies.\n\nIn November the American people elected a Republican House as an emergency brake to end one-party rule in Washington, DC. The Republican House will prevent the next two years from being like the last two.\n\nUnder Biden we have seen the worst inflation in 40 years, the worst energy crisis in 40 years, and the worst border crisis in American history.\n\nTwo out of three Americans say our nation is on the wrong track, and just four in 10 Americans approve of the job Biden is doing in office. It\u2019s time for Democrats to listen to the American people and move to the middle.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSenate Republicans are united behind the priorities of the people. We want to stop the reckless spending, unleash American energy and secure the border. If Democrats are willing to do these things, then we will work with them. Yet if Democrats continue to drag our country to the far left, then we will do everything we can to stop them.\n\nTuesday night I will listen respectfully to the president\u2019s speech. Yet in this time of crisis, the American people aren\u2019t looking for empty words read from a teleprompter. We\u2019re looking for serious action on inflation, border security, and public safety.

Her co-host, David Webb, examined the issue against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"For the people that showed up, even say, during COVID and went to work when others sat at home and got a check, they're now the bosses.

To make matters worse, obtaining a college degree is becoming increasingly necessary to stay afloat in competitive job markets, but the cost of attending college has also gone up.\n\nWebb's response? The cost of college is not an excuse to get complacent.\n\n\"This is a growing group of people from universities, a lot of them with higher education, who spend a lot of money, get into debt and don't move on with their lives.

In addition, many millennials reported not knowing how to accomplish certain tasks that were once expected of adults.\n\nSome of the reported tasks were conducting an oil change, changing a tire, tying a tie, jump-starting a car and sewing a hole. In an increasingly digital and specialized world, many of these \"essential\" tasks have become not as necessary to know.\n\nBut Webb believes that millennials' penchant for technology should make learning said tasks easier than ever.\n\n\"Come on, you're millennials.

In April 2020, a federal judge ruled in favor of the groups, ordering the NMFS to issue tighter restrictions.\n\n\"Right whales have been getting tangled up and killed in lobster gear for far too long,\" Kristen Monsell, the oceans program litigation director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said at the time. \"This decision sends a clear signal that federal officials must protect these desperately endangered animals from more painful and deadly entanglements before it\u2019s too late.\"\n\nAs a result of the decision, the Biden administration moved forward with new regulations on lobster fishing equipment in May 2021. The coalition of environmental groups then filed another lawsuit challenging the new rule and, in July 2022, again received a favorable judgment from a federal court. CLF senior attorney Arica Fuller applauded the ruling, saying it made clear that \"fishery managers must do more to protect\" right whales.\n\nMAINE LOBSTERMEN WARN BIDEN ADMIN IS TRYING TO PUT THEM OUT OF BUSINESS WITH HARSH ECO RULES\n\nHowever, as a result of the litigation and tighter rules, Maine lawmakers and business leaders have argued that thousands of lobster fishing jobs are at risk.

The first restrictions were rolled out in May and more restrictions are planned for December 2024 and 2030.\n\n\"Friendship, Maine, is the name of the town that I grew up in and that I live in now and where all the previous generations in my family fished and operated from,\" Dustin Delano, a fourth-generation lobsterman, told FOX Business in December. \"Basically, the lobster industry is the backbone \u2014 that's what everything was built around and that's pretty much the only option we have here.

Debris, including drug paraphernalia and human feces, began to litter the streets again. Panhandlers quickly followed, as tourist traffic picked up.\n\nNothing changed, really.\n\nCALIFORNIA PROSTITUTION LAW ALLOWS SEX ABUSE TO 'RUN RAMPANT' IN LOS ANGELES STREETS, VICTIM ADVOCATES WARN\n\nIt\u2019s a predicament with which California voters are all too familiar, and with which Gov. Gavin Newsom appears to be fed up.\n\n\"Californians demand accountability and results, not settling for the status quo,\" Newsom said in a recent statement as he announced his new budget. \"As a state, we are failing to meet the urgency of this moment.\"\n\nYet the homelessness industry he\u2019s helped establish \u2014 first as mayor of San Francisco, then as governor of the Golden State \u2014 isn\u2019t designed to achieve meaningful results. Called \"Housing First,\" it\u2019s a model that explicitly rejects accountability.\n\nInitially instituted in 2013 at the federal level as a one-size-fits-all approach to homelessness \u2014 with the unambiguous promise it would end homelessness in a decade \u2014 California became the only state in the country to also adopt it in 2016.\n\nIts champions opined that homelessness is \"solved\" by providing people with permanent housing without conditions \u2014 no sobriety, no expectations of even the most basic of standards of behavior and cleanliness and no expectation of work, ever.\n\nIn other words, no expectation of change, ever. Predictably, it\u2019s not working.\n\nPre-pandemic data from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) revealed a 20.5% increase in the unsheltered population and a 47.1 % increase in unsheltered homelessness in California under Housing First. These trends unfortunately continue in the post-pandemic era.\n\nHuman beings and communities are perishing. A conservative estimate from the New York Times puts the death toll of California\u2019s homeless population at 4,800 in 2021. According to the Jama Network, approximately one unsheltered person per day takes their final breath on the streets of San Francisco. The Times adds that in Los Angeles County, \"the unsheltered died in record numbers, an average of five deaths a day, most in plain view of the world around them.\"\n\nBut there\u2019s hope \u2014 real hope. When the underlying diseases of mental illness and addiction are addressed (diseases that are either a precursor to or are a result of homelessness), we can redeem lives, families, and communities.\n\nBut within minutes of the storms subsiding, the open-air drug use and the drug dealer huddles re-appeared. Debris, including drug paraphernalia and human feces, began to litter the streets again. Panhandlers quickly followed, as tourist traffic picked up. Nothing changed, really.\n\nAsk Tom Wolf. Up until 2018, Tom was a heroin addict who was \"homeless and hopelessly addicted\" on San Francisco\u2019s streets. Thanks to local law enforcement who saw something in Tom that he could not see, and thanks to their \"gift\" of jail time that allowed him to detox and clear his head \u2014 followed by a six-month stay in a therapeutic, sober environment \u2014 Tom is five years sober today. He is reunited with his wife and children and is now working the streets he once called home to help free others from the misery and grips of that life.\n\nOr ask Adrianna Granlund, a recovering alcoholic, drug addict and formerly homeless mother. Like most people experiencing homelessness, Adrianna had burned through her safety nets of family, friends, and community. \"After years of addiction, my family didn\u2019t want anything to do with me.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\n\"At one point, I was gifted \u2018permanent housing,\u2019 but because there were no conditions such as sobriety, my addiction spiraled out of control. Child Protective Services eventually took custody of my children, which in turn, fueled my eviction from our families-only housing unit.\"\n\nAdrianna eventually found her way to Saint John\u2019s \u2014 a Sacramento-based program for homeless women and children that I ran for 13 years. She arrived exhausted and \"out of her best ideas.\" Through intensive therapy, onsite groups such as Alcoholics and Narcotics Anonymous, and our high expectation/high accountability framework, a spark was ignited in Adrianna. Her spark grew as she lived side-by-side with other women struggling with similar issues. They became her biggest cheerleaders, but they also kept her accountable.\n\nToday, Adrianna has five years of sobriety. She works as an alcohol and drug counselor (and just made supervisor). She has custody of her children and owns a home. \"I needed accountability,\" she said. \"Without it, I\u2019d still be out there on the street.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe vacuum of accountability in today\u2019s homeless system \u2014 from the individual level to the non-profit level to the local government level to his level \u2014 is exactly why Newsom won\u2019t see the results he\u2019s demanding. \"Status quo maintenance\" is the cornerstone of his $16 billion investment in homelessness, and he is certain to achieve it.\n\nJust ask Tom and Adrianna.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM MICHELE STEEB"}, {"title": "Push for a 4-day work week picks up steam \u2014 and critics", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/push-4-day-work-week-picks-steam-critics", "tag": "JOBS", "content": "A growing number of lawmakers, business leaders, and academics are pushing for the U.S. to embrace a four-day work week, leading critics to question the wisdom of what would be a cultural sea change for the country.\n\nMaryland state lawmakers recently introduced a bill that would incentivize companies to switch to a four-day workweek, allowing employees to work 32 hours instead of 40 without losing any pay or benefits.\n\nThe state would subsidize employers that want to make the change. Specifically, the Maryland Department of Labor would administer a five-year pilot program to study the possibility of a shorter work week without any reduction in pay. Companies that agree to participate by trying out a 32-hour workweek without reducing their full-time employees' weekly pay would be eligible for a state tax credit.\n\nMARYLAND LAWMAKERS DEBATING BILL TO REQUIRE CURBSIDE VOTING\n\nCritics question whether the cost-benefit analysis would be worth it for employers.\n\n\"Not every business is able to cut its work time while maintaining the same level of salaries,\" said Mary Elizabeth Elkordy, founder of the remote-based company Elkordy Global Strategies. \"Companies need to produce the same level of work, so they may need to hire and train more people. Would the tax breaks offered be enough to cover these extra expenses? This could cause businesses to really sweat.\"\n\nElkordy explained a four-day work week could work well for some businesses in certain areas, especially those with long or unconventional hours such as nurses or firefighters, but questioned its practicality in service-based industries where pay is directly tied to a person's time and output.\n\nThe Maryland legislature is set to hold hearings on the bill later this month.\n\nUS JOB GROWTH UNEXPECTEDLY SURGES IN JANUARY AS ECONOMY ADDS 517,000 NEW POSITIONS\n\n\"I really think that this idea, while it may sound radical or utopian, is something that offers a real win-win possibility for both employers and employees,\" Maryland State Delegate Vaughn Stewart, the bill's sponsor, told NewsNation.\n\nThe bill's been referred to a committee in the State House but would need approval from the whole chamber, the State Senate, and the governor to go into effect. If it becomes law this legislative session, the measure would take effect on July 1 and expire in 2028.\n\n\"I don't think that Marylanders should be lining up and thinking that this is going to happen overnight,\" said Stewart. \"But I do think the time has come for this conversation, and I think the time has come for us to start looking at the future and envisioning a future with more free time.\"\n\nAccording to Stewart, the impetus for his bill was a recent study by the nonprofit 4 Day Week Global, which conducted a trial of several companies working a four-day week. The pilot program found most participating companies experienced a general increase in revenue and productivity and won't go back to a traditional five-day work week.\n\nProponents of the four-day work week argue it will create a happier and more productive workforce. However, Elkordy questioned whether that would stick following an initial \"honeymoon phase\" of less work with the same pay.\n\nFOUR-DAY WORK WEEK TREND GAINING POPULARITY AS COMPANIES REPORT STRONG PRODUCTIVITY LEVELS\n\n\"On Monday mornings, it will take time for people to get going regardless,\" she said. \"And it's just human nature that on the last day of the work, people tend to take it easier whether it's a Thursday or a Friday. You may over time end up getting less quality hours from employees during the week.\"\n\nElkordy, who said she understands the need for personal time and a work-life balance, noted Maryland's proposal and others like it could create \"bad will\" among business owners who may not be able to participate in the program, especially at a time of layoffs in the tech sector and a looming recession.\n\nBeyond Maryland, a California bill that would've required companies with 500 or more employees to pay overtime to employees who worked over 32 hours a week stalled last year. At the federal level, Rep. Mark Takano (D-Calif.) introduced a similar bill to change the work week to 32 hours.\n\nOutside government, a growing number of business leaders have been delivering TED Talks on the merits of a four-day work week, and academics have been increasingly floating the idea. Meanwhile, a recent CNN opinion piece praised Maryland for \"striking a blow at the absurd American culture of over-work.\"\n\nHowever, doubts remain about whether it can break through to the mainstream \u2014 in part because of America's culture of elevating work ethic as a key value.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Never say never. But I'm not anticipating it happening anytime soon,\" Matthew Bidwell, management professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business, said last year. \"I don't think there's a huge clamor for it. We are a bit of a workaholic nation, and we don't even take very much holiday.\"\n\nBidwell's colleague, Wharton assistant management professor Lindsey Cameron, said she didn't believe \"our employers are going to believe that you can get as much work done in four days as in five.\""}, {"title": "Trillion-dollar coin, 14th Amendment: Dems, academics float radical options for Biden in debt ceiling standoff", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trillion-dollar-coin-14th-amendment-dems-academics-float-radical-options-biden-debt-ceiling-standoff", "tag": "ECONOMY", "content": "Amid a looming showdown over raising the debt ceiling, Democrats in Congress and liberal lawyers, economists, and academics outside government are pushing ideas to address the debt limit without needing to hear Republicans' concerns.\n\nMany of these ideas are unconventional, proposing for the White House to circumvent Congress unilaterally. Some observers, for example, have called on the Treasury Department to mint a new $1 trillion platinum coin and deposit it at the Federal Reserve. The money would allow the federal government to fund more spending in order to finance its obligations.\n\nRep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) and Willamette University law professor Rohan Grey are among those who've backed such an idea, which has increasingly gained prominence in recent weeks. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellin recently dismissed the minted coin as a \"gimmick\" that the Federal Reserve may not even choose to accept.\n\nYELLEN REJECTS MINTING $1T PLATINUM COIN TO AVOID US DEBT CEILING AS A 'GIMMICK'\n\nOther ideas being floated include invoking the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which says the federal government's public debts must be repaid. \"Section 4 of the 14th Amendment says the threat to default is itself unconstitutional,\" Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe told the Washington Post, making a legal argument for Biden essentially ignoring the debt limit.\n\nHere are five other ideas being pushed by some experts and White House allies to bypass Congress:\n\nSelling federal land to raise cash quickly\n\nBreaking the debt limit by declaring it would violate already enacted spending laws to stop borrowing money\n\nAsking the Federal Reserve to send ahead of time to the Treasury the income from interest payments made on government bonds that the Fed has been holding\n\nIssuing bonds that keep paying interest without a maturity date that could be sold into the secondary market and bring in cash to the government without counting against the borrowing limit\n\nBuying back government bonds issued with lower interest rates that are now available on the secondary market for less than face value because the Federal Reserve has since raised interest rates\n\n\"These aren't technical problems, but problems with politics and perception: The people in the administration are uncomfortable violating norms of how things are done,\" J.W. Mason, an economist at the City University of New York who supports some of these ideas, told the Washington Post. \"The problem is that everything in this space is a gimmick. That's the nature of the problem. It's just a question of which gimmick you prefer.\"\n\nFox News Digital reached out to the White House for comment on these proposals. A spokesperson pointed to recent comments by Biden administration officials dismissing such ideas.\n\nHOW A GROUP OF DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS COULD BYPASS MCCARTHY AND LIFT THE DEBT CEILING\n\n\"We're not considering any measures that would go around Congress,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters last month. \"Congress must act. Both Republicans and Democrats in Congress have repeatedly raised the debt ceiling, including three times under the last president \u2026 and we believe they need to do that again.\"\n\nPresident Biden and administration officials have insisted Congress pass a \"clean\" increase of the debt ceiling without any other budget changes or concessions to Republicans, many of whom say they won't back a debt limit hike unless it includes attached spending cuts or fiscal reforms.\n\nLike the White House, Democrats in Congress also want a clean debt limit increase. To that end, some have reportedly been discussing a procedural tool to force a debt ceiling hike to the House floor by circumventing conservatives and House GOP leadership. The obscure process, known as a discharge petition, requires a majority of the House \u2014 218 signatures, regardless of party \u2014 to move a bill from committee to the floor for a vote.\n\n\"A discharge petition would only take myself and four of my colleagues on the GOP side to sign with Democrats, if that's necessary,\" Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.), co-chair of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, told CNN.\n\nWhile the effort is seen as unlikely to work or even be attempted, it's another indication of lawmakers and like-minded academics seeking a way to raise the debt ceiling without engaging Republicans over their budgetary concerns.\n\nDEMOCRATS PUSH TO ELIMINATE THE DEBT CEILING, ALLOW UNLIMITED GOVERNMENT BORROWING\n\n\"Democrats want to get rid of the debt ceiling and give Uncle Sam an unlimited credit card,\" said Stephen Moore, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation and an economist with FreedomWorks. \"That would be financially catastrophic.\"\n\nSome Democrats have openly expressed support for the discharge petition. When asked whether he'd endorse the idea,\" Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) told the Hill, \"If it's a clean debt ceiling \u2014 in a heartbeat.\"\n\nHowever, economists who spoke to Fox News Digital expressed concern about the petition and other ideas being floated that don't involve both parties coming together to address the debt ceiling and GOP budgetary concerns.\n\n\"The various workarounds on this issue being suggested by some Democrats all have problems and would be accompanied by prolonged market uncertainty,\" said Desmond Lachman, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. \"There would seem to be no realistic alternative but for the Democrats and Republicans to reach an early deal and spare the U.S. public from adding to the already many recession risks.\"\n\nDouglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, grouped these so-called workarounds into two categories: \"one-time measures that raise some cash but merely delay the inevitable\" or \"ad hoc procedures for which there may be no legal basis or hope of operational feasibility.\"\n\nBecause these ideas to circumvent Republicans or Congress altogether are unlikely, Democrats will need at least some Republican votes to raise the debt ceiling \u2014 meaning a compromise of one kind or another.\n\n\"There is no disagreement about the importance of honoring the debt obligations,\" said Holtz-Eakin. \"The only disagreement is over whether there should be a change in the outlook for spending and deficits, and I believe there should be no disagreement on that issue, either.\"\n\nMCCARTHY SAYS HE SEES AN 'OPPORTUNITY TO COME TO AN AGREEMENT' ON DEBT CEILING AFTER 'VERY GOOD' BIDEN MEETING\n\nPresident Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) met on Wednesday to discuss the debate ceiling issue. While no agreement was reached, McCarthy described the meeting as a \"very good discussion\" and said he sees an \"opportunity here to come to an agreement.\"\n\nStill, McCarthy said Republicans oppose a clean debt limit hike without attached spending cuts to ensure a sounder fiscal position for the country moving forward. However, he noted cuts for social programs like Social Security and Medicare are off the table.\n\nThe country compiles deficits when government spending exceeds incoming revenues, which come mainly from taxes. The current debt is the accumulation of annual deficits over decades. Raising the debt limit (also known as the debt ceiling) doesn't allow for new federal spending but instead allows the Treasury to borrow additional funds to cover expenditures already approved by Congress.\n\nLate last year, lawmakers capped the borrowing limit at $31.4 million, which the federal government proceeded to reach last month. Yellen subsequently told congressional leaders that the Treasury can take \"extraordinary measures\" to pay the country's bills on time until at least early June, by which time both parties hope to reach some sort of deal.\n\nHowever, there's debate over what exactly would happen in the event the debt ceiling isn't raised by then. One risk is that the U.S. defaults on its debts, a scenario that would likely have huge financial reverberations worldwide.\n\nMCCARTHY ON BIDEN DEBT CEILING MEETING: A TRUE 'NEGOTIATION'; GOP WILL 'UNITE BEHIND ONE PLAN'\n\n\"A U.S. government debt default would be a major U.S. and world economic event that could shake world financial markets and heighten the risk of a deep recession,\" said Lachman. \"Such a default would imply that the world's largest sovereign debtor could not be relied upon to meet its commitments. This is the last thing that we need at a time that both the U.S. and the world economy could be on the cusp of an economic recession.\"\n\nLachman noted that a similar debt showdown in 2011 showed that even if the U.S. doesn't ultimately default on its debt but reaches close to the deadline without an agreement, markets can be shaken by uncertainty and the country's credit rating can be downgraded, adding to the government's borrowing costs.\n\n\"For this reason, it is essential that Congress and the Biden administration put country ahead of narrow political interests to reach an early compromise on this issue,\" he added.\n\nHowever, other economists don't see the situation nearly as dire for the country.\n\n\"The chances of a debt default are about 0.01% \u2014 it isn't going to happen, even if they don't raise the debt ceiling,\" said Moore, who argued that if the government couldn't borrow more to meet its obligations in full and on time, it would force Washington to operate on a balanced budget until the debt ceiling is raised.\n\nDEBT CEILING INCREASE SENDS DEMS INTO FULL APOCALYPSE MODE: \u2018CHAOS,\u2019 \u2018RECESSION,\u2019 \u2018GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS\u2019\n\nHe described a scenario in which the government would create a priority list, paying the debt, social security, Medicare, and other programs but not financing, for example, certain clean energy programs while allowing, potentially, the Education Department to shut down for a few weeks.\n\n\"I'm not advocating for that \u2014 I want to see a compromise that raises the ceiling with the condition of spending cuts,\" said Moore. \"But let's be clear: This isn't Armageddon. The threat to the economy is when we raise debt ceiling without any plan to get out of debt \u2014 Democrats have the whole thing backward.\"\n\nA recent Rasmussen survey found that a majority of likely voters would rather have a partial government shutdown until Congress can agree to either cut spending or keep it the same rather than greenlight more spending with a clean debt ceiling increase.\n\nPerhaps the key takeaway is that no one really knows what'll happen.\n\n\"We don't know how bad it would be,\" said Shai Akabas, director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center. \"But as the preeminent leader of the global economy, no one likes to see us in position so untested.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAkabas explained it's possible the issue would get resolved quickly without serious consequences.\n\n\"But there are so many risks and so much uncertainty,\" he said. \"We need our leaders to bring both sides to the table and find compromise that can address the nation's fiscal challenges and meet our obligations.

The short answer is no, as 81% see the U.S. as a dysfunctional family that\u2019s breaking apart, up from 71% two years ago. That sentiment hits 86% among Republicans and independents, and 74% among Democrats. Overall, only 16% describe the country as a tight-knit family emerging from challenging times.\n\nThe survey also reveals sizable majorities rate economic conditions negatively (80%) and generally feel unhappy with how things are going in the country (73%). That\u2019s the second-highest dissatisfaction rating on a Fox survey in 10 years, only behind 75% in August 2022.\n\nCompared to early in the president\u2019s term (April 2021), negative views of the economy have increased 11 points and dissatisfaction with how things are going has increased by 20 points. What\u2019s worse for Biden, that 20-point increase comes mainly from a 35-point rise in discontent among Democrats.\n\nThere\u2019s more. Five times as many voters say they are falling behind financially as getting ahead, and only one in 10 thinks inflation is under control. In fact, three-quarters expect a recession this year, including majorities of Democrats (65%), independents (72%) and Republicans (83%).\n\nBIDEN ADMIN RELENTS, EXPECTED TO APPROVE OIL DRILLING PERMITS IN ALASKA: REPORT\n\nOverall, nearly nine in 10 are extremely or very concerned about inflation (86%). Large numbers also worry about crime rates (80%), political divisions in the country (78%) and U.S. opioid addiction (76%), and sizable majorities are concerned about the U.S. debt limit (68%), Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine (68%), gun laws (66%), border security (65%) and immigration (63%).\n\nInflation is the only concern that ranks in the top three for both Democrats and Republicans.\n\nAgainst that dismal backdrop, the survey finds voters lack faith in their leaders.\n\nUnder half have a great deal or some confidence in Biden (45%), Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts (44%), U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland (40%), House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (39%), Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell (39%) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (38%). For comparison, former President Donald Trump\u2019s confidence number (44%) roughly matches Biden\u2019s.\n\nWhen the president gives his speech Tuesday before a joint session of Congress, he\u2019ll have the highest approval rating in the room: 45% of voters approve of Biden\u2019s performance and 54% disapprove. That\u2019s unchanged since December (44%-56%) and October (46%-53%).\n\n\"Neither good nor bad news over the past year has affected Biden\u2019s numbers,\" says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, who conducts the Fox survey with Republican Daron Shaw. \"His 45% approval is certainly not good by historical standards, but maybe it\u2019s not bad in this hyper-partisan era -\u2014 maybe it is more durable than stuck.\"\n\nAlthough not by a lot, Biden\u2019s number tops approval of Vice President Kamala Harris (39%), the Supreme Court (41%) and Congressional Democrats (42%) and Republicans (38%).\n\nAmong Democrats, approval stands at 88% for Biden, 77% for Harris and 82% for Congressional Democrats. Only 65% of Republicans approve of GOP lawmakers.\n\nBiden starts his third year in office with fewer than half of voters approving of how he\u2019s handling inflation (31% approve-66% disapprove), immigration and border security (both 35%-61%), the economy (37%-61%), and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine (45%-51%).\n\nDespite those lackluster ratings, his approval has been inching up on the economy and holding steady on border security \u2014 and those represent record highs on Russia/Ukraine and inflation.\n\nDOJ SEARCHES BIDEN DELAWARE BEACH HOME AMID CLASSIFIED DOCUMENT INVESTIGATION\n\nLarge minorities think Biden \"cares about people like me\" (44%) and is honest and trustworthy (42%), and about one-third say he\u2019s a strong leader (35%).\n\nWhile his trait ratings are unchanged over the last year, they are down significantly compared to before he won the presidency. Since October 2020, Biden\u2019s empathy number is down 12 points, honesty is down 10 points and strong leader is down 14 points.\n\nAt the same time, Biden\u2019s job performance and honesty ratings remain mostly unchanged since the finding of classified documents in his home and office space.\n\nThat\u2019s because while Trump, Biden and former Vice President Mike Pence are each in the hot seat for mishandling classified documents, voters see significant differences in their situations.\n\nJust over half, 51%, think Trump did something illegal, while 37% think Biden did something illegal and 22% say the same of Pence.\n\nMore Republicans think Trump (23%) and Pence (17%) did something illegal in mishandling the documents than Democrats think Biden did (10%).\n\nAbout seven in 10 think it\u2019s very or somewhat important for Congress to investigate Biden\u2019s (70%) and Trump\u2019s (67%) treatment of classified materials, while fewer than six in 10 feel that way about Pence\u2019s (56%).\n\nAnother seven in 10 say it\u2019s important there is a congressional investigation into federal agencies potentially being biased against conservatives (71%), the origins of COVID-19 (70%) and the U.S.' withdrawal from Afghanistan (68%), with six in 10 saying Congress should investigate Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings (61%).\n\nCLICK HERE FOR TOPLINE AND CROSSTABS\n\nConducted Jan. 27-30, under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News Poll included interviews with 1,003 registered voters nationwide who were randomly selected from a voter file and spoke with live interviewers on both landlines and cellphones.

Our company, Burgos Group, became a vehicle for realizing the American Dream of two brothers who are first-generation Americans\u2014our father emigrated from Ecuador and is now a U.S. citizen.\n\nUnder the Obama and Trump administrations, our company grew from two to 195 employees with a track record of completing over 100 sustainability, renovation and modernization projects for 13 different federal agencies from coast to coast. Our growth landed us on the Inc. 5000 Fastest Growing Private Companies list six years in a row\u2014something achieved by only three percent of the companies on that list.\n\nHowever, since President Biden came to office, our workforce has shrunk by 40 percent! Never in my life have I experienced the economic or regulatory challenges that I am facing right now.\n\nConstruction materials prices are up more than 36 percent since the start of COVID-19. Recently, we asked a supplier to rebid electrical transformers for a project and the price came back more than double what it had been the last time it was quoted. Even worse, there is a 105-107-week lead time, meaning a potential project delay of two years.\n\nAdditionally, construction business owners like me are facing a workforce shortage of over half a million workers nationwide.\n\nInstead of removing barriers to winning work, the Biden administration advances anti-competitive policies that shut the door to opportunities for businesses like mine to participate in the largest investment in infrastructure this country has ever seen. President Biden\u2019s policies are a double-whammy to my community. They will raise the costs of the projects, which means more money on fewer projects, to the detriment of our neighborhoods.\n\nNew Mexico is a minority-majority state comprised predominantly of minority-owned small businesses, particularly in the construction industry. 90 percent of construction workers in New Mexico choose not to belong to a union. So, when President Biden mandates project labor agreements on federal construction projects over $35 million in New Mexico via Executive Order 14063, they are steering contracts and jobs away from the New Mexico construction community to large, out-of-state unionized contractors from Los Angeles, Chicago and New York.\n\nThe union leaders who will profit from anti-competitive PLA defend the policy by saying it is only for large projects over $35 million. What they conveniently leave out is the fact that all federal projects that go to large businesses require small business subcontractors. Merit shop small businesses like mine will be forced to either watch the work go to out-of-state firms from big city, union hot spots, or will have to tell the majority of their workers they cannot work on the contract because President Biden has mandated that we hire from union halls.\n\nWorse, cities like Albuquerque are following the administration\u2019s lead in an even more punitive manner. When the Biden administration created new policies pushing PLAs on hundreds of billions of dollars of federally assisted projects procured by state and local governments, the mayor of Albuquerque vetoed the City Council rejection of a PLA mandate and put it place for every city project at less than one third of that the federal threshold\u2014$10 million\u2014in an attempt to curry favor with the administration and win more federal agency infrastructure grant money.\n\nForced PLA agreements keep small businesses small and move the American Dream further from the grasp of minority communities.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nUnder a mandatory PLA policy, our company would not have had the same opportunity for growth. Instead of hiring employees, finding work and growth opportunities for them from one project to the next, our company would have been forced to shift the work from our employees to labor from union halls for the length of the project. When the project is done, those union workers will go back to the hall to work for other contractors, and our small business will no longer have a base of existing employees with which to build and grow our business. In the unlikely event a PLA allows a small number of my existing nonunion employees to work on a PLA project, they would have to pay as much as 34 percent of their paychecks in union dues and union benefits and lose all contributions unless they join a union and become vested in those plans.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEW APP\n\nIn addition, research has found PLA mandates increase the cost of construction 12 percent to 20 percent. In short, PLAs are a lose-lose for taxpayers, the vast majority of America\u2019s construction workforce and quality small businesses like mine. Despite having a strong track record as a federal contractor that has resulted in awards from the Small Business Administration, Burgos Group will not bid on projects with PLAs in place. This means one less qualified and proven minority-owned small business competing for work.\n\nThe Biden administration is giving big city unions exactly what they want, and my community is suffering."}, {"title": "All GOP senators, Manchin challenge Biden's ESG climate investment rule 'politicizing' Americans' 401(k)s", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-senators-manchin-challenge-bidens-esg-climate-investment-rule-politicizing-americans-401ks", "tag": "ENVIRONMENT", "content": "EXCLUSIVE: Every Republican senator and Democrat Joe Manchin are introducing legislation that they hope will terminate the Biden administration's new environment, social and governance (ESG) rule, which they say \"politicizes\" the retirement savings for 152 million Americans.\n\nThe Biden administration's Department of Labor unveiled a rule in November, set to go into effect on Jan. 30, that allows retirement plan managers to factor environmental and social issues into investment decisions.\n\nThe bipartisan disapproval resolution led by Sen.

It is not \u2018woke,\u2019\" wrote Fink. \"It is capitalism, driven by mutually beneficial relationships between you and the employees, customers, suppliers, and communities your company relies on to prosper \u2026 Make no mistake, the fair pursuit of profit is still what animates markets; and long-term profitability is the measure by which markets will ultimately determine your company's success.\"\n\nA key part of stakeholder capitalism is environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing, which is based on the concept that investors should use these three broad categories when evaluating where to put their money, prioritizing progressive values and \"social responsibility\" when making financial decisions.\n\nThe theory underpinning ESG is that corporations should deemphasize their traditional responsibility to maximize value for shareholders and instead make new commitments to alternative stakeholder groups, serving other interests and society at large.\n\nBLACKROCK NOT CHANGING STANCE ON ESG INVESTING, DESPITE CRITICISM\n\nMany investors now use ESG as a rating system to measure a company's advancement of policies designed to address climate change, increase corporate board demographic diversity and support a progressive \"social justice\" agenda, among other initiatives.\n\nESG has become increasingly influential in recent years, evolving into a $35 trillion industry, with that much in global assets being invested using ESG principles.\n\nBy 2025, global ESG assets are expected to exceed $53 trillion, representing more than one-third of the $140.5 trillion in projected total assets under management.\n\nHowever, critics of what they describe as \"corporate wokeness\" have been mobilizing against the march of ESG advocates.\n\n\"We think that banks should be non-political. Banks should not be a political party,\" Rep. Andy Barr, R-Ky., chair of the House Financial Services subcommittee responsible for financial institutions and monetary policy, told the Financial Times. \"Banks should serve creditworthy borrowers and focus on earnings and profitability for their shareholders.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAt the state level, Florida, Texas and a few other GOP-led states have begun implementing measures to push back on ESG policies, such as divesting from BlackRock.

But now a lawsuit filed on behalf of Portland residents with disabilities has uncovered the source of perhaps the vast majority of those tents\u2014taxpayers.\n\nJohn DiLorenzo, who represents the plaintiffs in an Americans with Disabilities Act lawsuit against Portland, said, \"The taxpayers are paying the county to put tents in place, which the city is in turn charging the taxpayers to sweep up.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s sort of like trying to walk up the down escalator,\" he added.\n\nDuring the discovery phase of the lawsuit, DiLorenzo says he learned Multnomah County\u2019s Joint Office of Homeless Services (JOHS) paid $2 million for 22,000 new tents and 70,000 tarps.

This can only happen in a highly competitive market.\n\nMake no mistake: politics and ideology are driving this war on American tech, not consumer protection. Just look at the biography of Lina Khan, who leads the FTC. Khan rocketed to fame via a law school paper complaining about Amazon\u2019s prices being too low. Then, she gave progressive speeches, including one where she lauded a far-left organization that claims \"the free market is dead\" and calls for universal basic income.\n\nOnce installed at the FTC, Khan launched several progressive attacks, including blaming gas stations as the cause of high gas prices and meat producers for expensive hamburgers. She is another example of a Biden administration official who is attacking the private sector despite never having worked in it.\n\nAs her zeal for combating low prices shows, Khan shows little care about American consumers and is shamelessly using her powerful position to advance progressive policies. And while she may believe her ideals will help, reality shows they will cost Americans their jobs.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen what out-of-touch progressivism looks like \u2013 an economy that is failing with runaway inflation. While the elites at the FTC complain about prices being too low, Americans suffer daily from soaring grocery and gas bills.

It is a \"by any means necessary\" approach to governance that tends to set aside facts, the law and the Constitution in pursuit of political goals.\n\nBut make no mistake: Biden\u2019s attack on jobs does not stop with tech. FTC commissioners want to revive rules that would ban bulk discounts on goods. They are actively trying to block Coke and Pepsi from giving bulk discounts on soda, which would cripple the benefits we enjoy at Costco and Sam\u2019s Club while costing those workers jobs.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen what out-of-touch progressivism looks like \u2013 an economy that is failing with runaway inflation.

We are looking at any known gain of function mutation. Such virus may be engineered to enable the assessment of antiviral activity in cells. Are you comfortable with this statement from Pfizer?

So I want you to talk to us about what these documents could be. Your you and your colleagues have been asking to get access to these documents. Certainly every member of the Senate Intelligence Committee wants to see these documents. They say enough is enough. But the DNI said no. She just basically said no. And what we have here is a letter to Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House, from the lawyers investigating this. And they are telling us that there's 1850 boxes of the documents, enough to fill a tractor trailer and the 415 gigabytes of electronic records. But the University of Delaware will not release who paid, who funded the archival and the maintenance of these documents. Was it communist China?\n\nPENCE SPEAKS OUT FOR FIRST TIME AFTER CLASSIFIED DOCS FOUND IN INDIANA HOME: 'MISTAKES WERE MADE'\n\nSENATOR TED CRUZ: Well, that's certainly a reasonable inference, it seems. Joe Biden certainly when Joe Biden went to pan communist China, paid millions of dollars to fund what he was doing. Communist China, we also know, paid Hunter Biden and the Biden family millions of dollars. And so there's a long history of communist China writing checks. The fact that University of Delaware has tried to keep these documents secret. In fact, it said it's not going to release any of them until two years after Biden leaves public office. I think that's unacceptable. And let me say, the content of these documents. Last week, the administration briefed the Intelligence Committee. And I got to tell you, the members of the Intelligence Committee that I spoke to were really frustrated. Both Republicans and Democrats were ticked off because essentially the administration said, go jump in the lake. We're not going to tell you anything. And that is thoroughly unacceptable. Look, there's a range of classified documents. I've read a lot of classified documents. Some are just general geopolitical observations. The consequences of that are not terribly significant. But there are other classified documents that involve sources and methods that implicate how we gather secret information. And some of the most delicate are those that can endanger the lives of covert operatives. We don't know if any of these documents fall into that category. There's an entirely different level that we need to know, which is whether any of these classified documents that Joe Biden had illegally in multiple locations involve his own family's business activities and potential corruption, whether they involve Burisma and Ukraine, whether they involve communist China and the entities that were paying the Biden family millions of dollars if he, in fact, had classified documents that implicate his own financial well-being. That raises the potential of very serious criminal liability.\n\nHARMEET DHILLON REACTS TO THE OUTCOME OF THE RNC RACE\n\nMARIA BARTIROMO: I mean, you've been talking about this need for new leadership now for the last two months, pretty actively. Walk us through what's most important and where you see the major mistakes within the Republican Party. What's the biggest problem?\n\nRNC'S RONNA MCDANIEL DECLARES 'THIS IS MY LAST TERM AS CHAIR'\n\nHARMEET DHILLON: Right. Well, you know, not to focus on anything personal, just, you know, mechanically, for several years, I feel like we've been behind the eight ball with respect to Democrats. So I'm a Republican election lawyer. And over the last decades, Democrats have downgraded the integrity of our elections and made it much easier for people to vote with ballots that are sent out, like shopping mailers on our side. What we have failed to do is really look at the fact that we're losing. Would that early voting be it mail, boat, voting, absentee voting or voting early in person? And my top campaign plank was that in order for us to win, we must simply mechanically beat the Democrats at hustling the ballots for our voters into the ballot boxes as early as possible. That doesn't mean you ignore election integrity. No, I mean, that's that's my bread and butter of what I do. It means that you've got to do both things and do them very well and mechanically inside the party. I've asked that we set up a separate department of election operations. The party was under a consent decree for several years, for decades, in fact, that prevented us from doing that work. But that expired four years ago. And so now we really need to ramp up and make sure that as we start voting in 2024, that we are able to beat the Democrats at getting our ballots in early. And if we're able to do that, all these other excuses about candidate quality and who endorsed whom and ticket splitting and, you know, whatever excuse you have, it just doesn't matter. When you look at how Democrats were able to elect John Fetterman, Joe Biden, the biggest liar in DC and Katie Hobbs. And so I know we can do it. We have to commit resources and energy and as a policy pull together to do that. Maria.\n\nMARIA BARTIROMO: So you're saying that the Democrats embrace early voting, they push for it, the Republicans don't.\n\nARIZONA REPUBLICANS ELECT FORMER TRUMP OFFICIAL JEFF DEWIT TO BECOME NEXT PARTY CHAIR, WILL REPLACE KELLI WARD\n\nHARMEET DHILLON: Oh, absolutely. I mean, in fact, our activists are a bit upset still about the 2020 election. I'm upset about it. Yeah, but the fact is that it is a fact and a law. And if you are not complying with and in fact, embracing and really beating the Democrats under the existing laws, even as you try to change them, we lose. We've seen it time and again. I've seen it with my own two eyes. In Arizona, 70% of the voters on Election Day there were there were malfunctioning scanners and tabulators vis a vis the machines. They were Republicans.

This is crazy. We ought to ban Tik Tok and we should get serious at every dimension that the risk of these classified documents. We need to find out the relationship between Hunter Biden and China and President Biden. All of these things are connected. And it's not about people. This isn't about being punitive. This is about doing the fundamental things that protect the American people.\n\nMARIA BARTIROMO: I mean, we know that Adam Schiff lied for four years, telling us that there was Russia collusion with Trump in plain sight. Now he wants to run for the Senate. Should this guy get another chance in a law making leading position after misleading the American people, dividing the country so much?\n\nDEMOCRATIC DARLINGS SCHIFF AND PORTER KICK OFF AN UGLY, EXPENSIVE FIGHT FOR CALIFORNIA'S SENATE SEAT\n\nMIKE POMPEO: Wow. So, Maria, I served with Adam Schiff in the House of Representatives on the Intelligence Committee, and then I had to deal with him when he was the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee when I was a CIA director. Right. Adam Schiff lied to the American people. He kept promising there'll be Russian collusion. Just wait. There's documents. There's stuff. I know this because I occupy this special place. I'm a member of the the Gang of Eight. This is the most sensitive classified information. I'm going to share this with. He said that we now know that was all a lie. We know and we know that he knew that it was a lie. It was fundamentally indecent. Speaker McCarthy made the absolute right decision not to permit him to be on the Intelligence Committee. He will protect America. Kevin McCarthy protected America by making that very decision. And I hope the good people of California will be smarter than to send someone who doesn't know how to handle classified information, who lied to America for at least two, two and a half years. Won't send him back to the United States Senate, but rather let him go out and get a different job in life.\n\nMARIA BARTIROMO: Real quick, Secretary, before you go, we're all expecting you to run for the president for 2024. Are you about ready to make that announcement soon?\n\nMIKE POMPEO BLASTS \u2018RECKLESS\u2019 ADAM SCHIFF: HE\u2019S \u2018ABUSED HIS POSITION\u2019 ON THE INTEL COMMITTEE\n\nMIKE POMPEO: We're in that this morning. But Susan and I are praying, trying to figure our way through that in the in the coming months, we'll make that decision.

I went last night and looked at and I'll give this to Senator Kennedy. He is an equal opportunity questioner. He also was really, really tough on some Republican presidential nominees asking them basic questions like, have you ever tried a case before? I think the bottom line is everyone should want really good judges for you. Just had Mike Lee on. Mike Lee may serve 30 years, but the the judges he picks will serve for life. This is a lifetime job.

If they're not prepared for it, things could get pretty ugly for people,\" he said.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) of 2021 amended a code section that decreased the minimum threshold for reporting by third-party settlement organizations (TPSOs) from $20,000 annually in cases of 200 or more transactions to $600 annually regardless of the number of transactions.\n\nHOUSE REPUBLICANS TO VOTE ON BILL ABOLISHING IRS, ELIMINATING INCOME TAX\n\nThe code change, approved by Democrats and signed by President Biden in March 2021, will require TPSOs like Venmo, PayPal, Etsy, AirBnB and more to send 1099-k forms to the IRS and to recipients of cash if their transactions exceed $600 annually. If a sports betting application like FanDuel or DraftKings uses these payment systems, you will face taxes there, though sports betting is already included under the current tax code.\n\n\"It's this huge fishing net that's just going to sweep up a vast amount of people in America,\" Willey said.\n\nThe code change will likely burden those engaged in sports fantasy leagues and sellers of professional sports tickets with additional obligations come tax season.\n\nBakerHostetler Nationwide Tax Chair Jeff Paravano described a situation in which an individual sells preseason games at a loss but still gets a 1099 for gross proceeds. The IRS will not know what the individual paid for those tickets and the person receiving the Form 1099 may need to provide further details.\n\nThe taxpayer may or may not have taxable income because of that reporting but could receive a Form 1099 for even selling one ticket, depending on the sale amount.\n\n\"Somebody that engages in a lot of fantasy sports; You can only deduct the losses to the extent of your winnings. But, you better be keeping receipts of your losses. Those will be a deduction against any winnings you received,\" Paravano, a former Senior Adviser to the Assistant Treasury Secretary for Tax Policy, said.\n\nParavano said the changes were also likely to impact fantasy sports leagues with money wagers conducted by coworkers, friends and family members. He suggested the 1099 would be doled out for the gross amount of winnings and would not be reduced by the wager. A 1099 also would be issued by the third party settlement organization to the person who collected the wagers and later doled out the winnings. Both the NCAA tournament or fantasy football organizer and the winners each may receive a 1099 for the gross amount received. Winners may deduct their wagers when computing the amount of tax due.\n\nIRS STAFF WOULD BE BANNED FROM TELEWORK UNDER GOP BILL UNTIL TAX RETURN BACKLOG IS ELIMINATED\n\n\"The fear is that the 1099 will be sent out for things that are not taxable income and the IRS doesn't have the capability to easily figure that out,\" he said.\n\nBoth tax experts suggested that the code changes could result in more audits and taxes for Americans or, at the very least, an increase in correspondence with the IRS.\n\nGovernment leaders have repeatedly pushed back on the idea that the IRS changes would negatively impact any Americans making under $400,000.\n\n\"Legislators are being disingenuous,\" Willey said. \"This is one of those things where they say one thing while they are taking your campaign donation and then they turn around and go to Washington and do something completely different.\"\n\n\"The reality of it is they said nobody making under $400,000 a year was going to have an increased chance of audit or pay more on taxes. That's a flat lie. That's not accurate. They're lying to you,\" he added.\n\nNational Taxpayer Advocate Erin Collins projected last week that the number of 1099s being filed would double once the code change goes into effect.\n\nThe Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that the new provision will raise 8.1 billion in revenue over a 10-year budget window.\n\nCalling it a \"stealth tax increase,\" Willey said it is a \"fantasy world\" to think that the move will not increase audits and taxes, including on some who have no increased taxable income.\n\n\"If it didn't increase anybody's taxes and didn't increase their chances of an audit, then what are the 87,000 new employees going to do, where's' the 9.1 billion that the estimated it's going to recover\u2014where'd that number come from? It's going to affect the fabric of American life,\" he said.\n\nNEW IRS TAX BRACKETS TAKE EFFECT IN 2023, MEANING YOUR PAYCHECK COULD BE BIGGER\n\nOutside of fantasy sports, Willey and Paravano also asserted that the IRS changes would impact Americans in various other ways.\n\nFor example, sending money to a kid in college can be considered a gift under the current U.S. tax code unless it exceeds $17,000. However, the student will still receive a 1099 and may be asked to provide proof of the gift to avoid paying taxes on the amounts recieved.\n\n\"The horror is that a parent who pays rent to a college student every month, guess what, their child may get a 1099,\" Paravano said.\n\nThe code changes will also cover transactions on Facebook marketplace, lending money to a friend, reimbursing a roommate for rent, paying a colleague for going out to dinner, repaying a bar tab, a mother sending a child gas money and raising funds from parents to purchase a coach a gift.\n\nIf a transaction provider like Venmo or PayPal is being used and total amount received by any one person is $600 or more during a calendar year, a 1099 will likely follow.\n\nInterestingly, taxpayers will not get a 1099 if they use Zelle because of the technical definitions of third-party settlement organizations. Generally, a check is the safest option to avoid triggering a 1099 for items that are not taxable income.\n\nThe IRS' current information return volume is 4 billion annually, with 99% filed electronically. They just rolled out a 1099 electronic information return portal.\n\nThe new system is expected to increase the paperwork and cause more instances of mismatch between the IRS and the taxpayer.\n\n\"In a vacuum, increasing information reporting doesn't seem bad. It certainly is in everyone's interest to make sure taxes are being paid on all forms of taxable income. But if we've got 4 billion information returns now, and we think that might double, there's going to be a lot of uneccesary noise in the data provided to the IRS and a lot of compliance burdens,\" Paravano said.\n\n\"The thing that comes up in my mind is the image of the dog catching bus. You caught the bus, what do you do with it. You've got all this new information reporting. What will the IRS do with it,\" he added.\n\nThere is support in the House and Senate from both parties to raise the threshold to $5,000.\n\nSNOOP SCOOP: NEW GOP BILL WOULD PUT STOP TO IRS' $600 ONLINE REPORTING REQUIREMENT\n\nSome Republicans, according to Paravano, would prefer to go back to the previous threshold of 20,000 and 200 transactions, but it will be challenging to put old rules back in place given the concern around budget deficits.\n\nWilley described the situation as an \"enforcement nightmare\" for the IRS and a nightmare for the taxpayer.\n\n\"You should be calling your legislature and complaining if they voted for this bill to all ends,\" he added.\n\nA 2022 IRS tax audit data study found that a taxpayer in the lowest income bracket is five times more likely to face an audit than a member of the highest income bracket.\n\n\"The IRS correspondence audit process is structured to expend the least amount of resources to conduct the largest number of examinations \u2013 resulting in the lowest level of customer service to taxpayers having the greatest need for assistance,\" taxpayer advocate Collins said of the report during an annual report to Congress.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe IRS in December said that it is delaying the new tax reporting requirement by one year and that the new rules will be applied to tax filings occurring in early 2024.\n\nThe IRS said the change was intended to hone in on Americans evading taxes by not reporting their full gross income. However, critics have labeled it as an overbroad government overreach likely to hurt middle-class Americans and small businesses.

Some of the largest Chinese tech companies are hopping on this bandwagon, and many are wondering if this will affect American jobs.\n\nAIR FORCE GENERAL PREDICTS WAR WITH CHINA 2025: \u2018I HOPE I AM WRONG\u2019\n\nWhat are virtual people?\n\nVirtual people are simulations of human beings on computers, also known as virtual characters or avatars. They combine animation, sound tech, and machine learning that create digitized human beings who can interact with people virtually.\n\nThese virtual employees can perform various tasks, such as customer service, data entry, and content creation. They can also be used in video games, virtual worlds, simulations, and be programmed to interact with people in various ways, such as on social media, digital marketing, and other forms of online communication.\n\nChina uses 2D and 3D virtual people to help grow their tech companies. Some have even appeared in American internet spaces, especially as social media influencers.\n\nHow much do virtual people cost to use?\n\nPart of the reason why these virtual people have grown so much in popularity over the years is that they cost so little to make. The price range spans from as little as $2,800 to as much as $14,300 to use per year.\n\nCosts are continuing to go down, as the price tag has already dropped 80% since last year. Some experts believe that due to these low costs, virtual people will continue to grow in popularity and that the industry could potentially grow up to 50% annually through 2025.\n\nBeijing city even announced a plan back in August of 2022 to continue growing their use of virtual people for companies with the hope to have the industry valued at over 50 billion yen by 2025.\n\nAre virtual people only being used in tech companies?\n\nTech companies are first to embrace virtual people, yet their presence among other industries is growing fast. China already has a plan to get more virtual people to work in broadcasting and manufacturing.\n\nThey also have them currently working in various financial services, local tourism boards, and state media. Many brands are especially looking for virtual people to represent them and help sell their content with the growing presence of cancel culture and many celebrities generating negative press over the years.\n\nIf more brands use virtual people, they won't have to worry about getting involved in personnel or criminal scandals like a human being could since everything about them is programmed.\n\nSCHIFF USES TIKTOK APP THAT BIDEN BANNED TO COMPLAIN ABOUT GETTING KICKED OFF HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE\n\nShould Americans be worried about their jobs?\n\nThe rapid growth of virtual people has certainly hit other areas of the world quicker than here in the U.S. As I mentioned, the presence of virtual social media influencers is undoubtedly growing on the internet.\n\nOther than that, some companies have just used virtual reality to help regularly train their frontline employees. Some of these companies include JetBlue, Walmart, and MGM Resorts. Many of them have found it helpful as their companies deal with serving the public in some capacity.\n\nRegarding virtual people taking over for actual humans, America is not quite at that point just yet. With the advent of ChatGPT that uses artificial intelligence to mimic human thinking, virtual employees could ultimately result in job losses for Americans as some businesses choose to automate specific tasks or outsource them to virtual workers.\n\nProponents argue that it is also possible the growth of virtual employees could lead to the creation of new human jobs, such as those related to the development and management of virtual workers.\n\nWhile the use of virtual employees can bring cost savings and increased efficiency to companies, it's important to consider the potential negative impacts. Aside from the obvious human job loss which could be colossal, virtual workers could bring about new privacy, misinformation, and accountability concerns.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOverall, the effect of virtual employees on the job market is likely to be complex and multifaceted. It's tough to make definitive predictions about how it will affect American workers. One thing is for sure, you know I will stay on this very important topic and bring you the latest developments as I see how virtual employees unfold and how it will affect you and your family.\n\nWhat do you think about virtual people?

Independent analysts say Biden\u2019s own actions, including his laws and executive orders, have had the overall effect of adding to current and projected future deficits, not reducing those deficits.\"\n\nIn addition to CNN, Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee targeted Biden's remarks from Thursday with a fact-check, claiming that the president \"did not let the facts get in the way of his speech in Springfield.\"\n\n\"While Biden claimed the economy is growing strong, the latest report on economic growth reveals that the economy under his Administration\u2019s policies has fallen short of expectations on seven out of the last eight economic growth reports,\" the committee wrote. \"In fact, the entirety of 2022 was worse for economic growth than expected. And even more trouble lies ahead, according to the latest Leading Economic Index report.\"\n\nListing five recent \"misleading\" claims from the president that the committee found fault with, the Republicans wrote: \"President Biden has been making inaccurate accusations about Republicans and fearmongering to scare seniors when Republicans have been clear we are not going to touch their retirement security. Biden has also been making Medicare and Social Security worse off \u2014 not protecting them. Medicare premiums have risen for seniors since 2020, while Biden\u2019s ongoing inflation crisis has pushed Social Security further towards insolvency.\"\n\nBiden recently faced criticism from FactCheck.org over claims he had made regarding unemployment during his speech at the U.S. Conference of Mayors\u2019 winter meeting last week.\n\nDuring the speech, according to FactCheck.org, Biden \"botched a statistic on the number of people receiving unemployment benefits, misidentifying them simply as the number of people \u2018out of work.\u2019\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"His comment leaves the false impression that unemployment declined by more than 16 million people on his watch, when the decline was actually under 5 million,\" the nonprofit website concluded. \"And a big reason for the large decline in unemployment benefits is the expiration of pandemic-related expansions of such benefits.\"\n\n\"Two years ago this week, 18 million people were out of work \u2014 two years ago this week,\" Biden said at the conference. \"Now the \u2014 that number is under 1.6 million, near the lowest level in decades.\"\n\n\"The White House transcript notes that the line drew applause,\" FactCheck.org stated. \"But it\u2019s not accurate.

And I can tell you, dealing with a lot of lower middle market companies, this rolls down and we're seeing the same percentage, not as big a number, but the same percentage on the lower middle market companies. And they're all being affected by one of the first decisions this president made when he was in office. And that's the effect on the energy policy. We were energy independent, and he surrendered our position. So by increasing fuel costs, it added to the cost of shipping product to make products, and then it added more costs by shipping it to the retail shelves. At the same time, shrinkflation, less ounces, less pieces per package. It's impossible to believe what he said about this robust economy.

We certainly forgot the man who invented it.\n\n\u2018The epic story of man\u2019\n\nOtto Frederick Rohwedder was born in Des Moines, Iowa, on July 7, 1880. His family made its way to Davenport at some point when he was a small child.\n\nHis father, Claus, was born in Kreis Dithmarschen, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, in 1845. He arrived in Iowa in 1866 and worked as a stone mason contractor. He \"designed the stone work on many of Davenport\u2019s prominent business buildings of former years,\" according to a 1922 obituary.\n\nRohwedder\u2019s mother, Elizabeth Margaretha Margaret (Jannssen), known as Margaret, was also born in Schleswig-Holstein and arrived in Iowa in 1868.\n\nShe and Claus wed the following year. They had four sons, including Otto, and one daughter.\n\nMEET THE AMERICAN WHO SAVED THE CHAMPAGNE INDUSTRY: MISSOURI SCIENTIST CHARLES VALENTINE RILEY\n\nRohwedder graduated from the Illinois College of Optometry in 1900 with a degree in optics. He ended up in the jewelry business, reportedly apprenticing in the trade as a teenager.\n\nHe operated three jewelry shops in St. Joseph, Missouri. The business struggled, by many accounts.\n\n\"Television is the greatest invention since sliced bread.\" \u2014 Red Skelton in 1951\n\nNobody knows how or why, but at some point in his 30s, Rohwedder conceived the idea of devising a way to slice bread at a commercial level. He returned to his hometown of Davenport in 1916 and used the funds from the sale of his jewelry business to pursue his dream.\n\nIt was a disaster.\n\n\"He spent all his time raising money, building a factory and working on his designs,\" said \"Sliced Bread\" Ed.\n\nRohwedder\u2019s mission to rewrite the epic story of man and bread appeared to end when fire destroyed his factory in nearby Monmouth, Illinois, in November 1917 \u2014 and with it his prototype bread slicer and the blueprints for it.\n\nRohwedder suffered one other setback, according to Douglas. He suffered a respiratory illness that doctors said might be fatal.\n\n\"They told him to give it up and get his affairs in order,\" Douglas said.\n\nHe ignored the advice. Instead, he went back to the drawing board, recreating his invention and soliciting the financing to produce it.\n\nHis health improved. And so did his inventive fortune.\n\nFinally, by 1928, he had a prototype \u2014 a machine that could slice and package bread right out of the oven.\n\nIt proved harder to convince people of sliced bread\u2019s potential.\n\nMEET THE AMERICAN WHO INVENTED BAND-AIDS: COTTON BUYER AND DEVOTED HUSBAND EARLE DICKSON\n\nThe baking industry cast off Rohwedder as a crackpot, as preposterous as this seems in hindsight.\n\nPeople baked their own bread at home or bought it by the loaf and cut it at home. The system worked well for thousands of years.\n\nNobody but Rohwedder thought there was a better way to sell bread.\n\n\"Few people in the industry believed that bread could be automatically sliced as it came off the assembly line,\" Aaron Bobrow-Strain wrote in his 2012 book, \"White Bread: A Social History of the Store-Bought Loaf.\"\n\n\"Bread was too unruly \u2026 Most bakers actively opposed factory slicing.\"\n\nRohwedder \"found no takers for the idea and had almost given up hope,\" the author added.\n\nInstant sensation\n\nYet Rohwedder finally found someone willing \u2014 perhaps equally desperate \u2014 to take a chance on his scheme to reinvent the staff of life.\n\nHis name was Frank Bench. He ran the struggling Chillicothe Baking Co. \u2014 and he was looking for a Hail Mary.\n\nHe ordered one of Rohwedder\u2019s slicing machines on July 1, 1928, and touted the news in the local Constitution-Tribune on July 6.\n\n\"The idea of sliced bread may be startling to some people,\" the story read, attempting to reassure customers who were surely shocked by the concept.\n\nM&M'S DITCHES SPOKESCANDIES - FOR NOW - AFTER STEPS TO PROMOTE INCLUSIVITY DEEMED TOO POLARIZING\n\n\"The Chillicothe Baking Company has installed a new multi-bladed bread slicer, which performs a feat which heretofore had been considered by bakers as being impossible \u2014 namely the slicing of fresh loaves.\"\n\nSliced Kleen Maid Bread, the first loaves of pre-sliced bread in human history, rolled out of Chillicothe Baking Co. a day later, on July 7, 1928 \u2014 which just happened to be Rohwedder's 48th birthday.\n\nThe bakery claimed \"the distinction of being the first bakers in the world to sell sliced bread to the public.\"\n\nIt was an instant sensation.\n\n\"Sales at the bakery shot up 1,000% in two weeks,\" Chillicothe tourism director Amy Supple told Fox News Digital.\n\nWord quickly spread throughout the industry. Rohwedder\u2019s records show orders for his machine began to flow in from across the Midwest.\n\nBy early 1929, he was selling slicing machines to bakeries and other businesses as far away as New York and Florida.\n\nON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, JAN. 18, 1943, GOVERNMENT BANS SLICED BREAD AMID WORLD WAR II RATIONING\n\nThe impact of sliced bread on the American household is evident by public reaction in 1943, at the depths of World War II, when the government announced it would begin rationing sliced bread.\n\nThe Roosevelt administration had already rationed sugar, meat and coffee.\n\nBut sliced bread proved too much to handle. The news incited a vocal rebellion among American homemakers.\n\n\"I should like to let you know how important sliced bread is to the morale and saneness of a household,\" distraught mother Sue Forrester of Fairfield, Connecticut, claiming to speak on behalf of America\u2019s housewives, lamented in a New York Times letter to the editor.\n\nIn 1928, the man who imagined sliced bread was treated as a crackpot. Fifteen years later, his invention was a necessity that people couldn\u2019t live without, even in wartime.\n\nWrites Bobrow-Strain, \"Otto Rohwedder, unappreciated and down on his luck, had achieved something nearly every member of the industrial baking establishment thought impossible.\"\n\nA community rediscovers its legacy\n\nOtto Frederick Rohwedder died on Nov. 8, 1960 in Concord, Michigan. He was 80 years old.\n\nHe\u2019s buried beside his wife, Carrie, beneath a humble headstone in Albion, Michigan.\n\nHe sold the invention by which all others are judged to Micro-Westco of Bettendorf, Iowa, in 1933, during the depths of the Great Depression, according to the American Society of Baking.\n\nHe worked for the company for the rest of his professional life as sales manager of its Rohwedder Bakery Machine Division \u2014 a sort of Johnny Appleseed of sliced-bread making. He retired in 1951.\n\nThe world continues to marvel at Rohwedder\u2019s achievement. The phrase \"the greatest thing since sliced bread\" has become deeply ingrained in our language.\n\nBut it largely forgot the man.\n\n\"This is a very family-oriented community,\" Chillicothe Mayor Theresa Kelly told Fox News Digital. \"We\u2019re very proud to be the home of sliced bread.\"\n\n\"You know 1928 was just prior of the Great Depression and World War II. It was that Greatest Generation,\" said Supple. \"And they were really great but humble people.\"\n\nChillicothe, Missouri, has recently rediscovered its history as the birthplace of the invention by which all others are compared.

She turns 75 this year, and she is on Medicare. Despite her family history with shingles, Patricia was unable to get the shingles vaccine \u2014 that was, until the Inflation Reduction Act made it free for hundreds of thousands of Virginia seniors like her.\n\nI\u2019m happy to report that Patricia received her first dose of the shingles vaccine this month. And in the coming weeks, she will receive a second free dose. This vaccine will protect her from an excruciatingly painful condition that affects more than 1 million Americans every year \u2014 sometimes causing severe complications for those over 60, who are at the greatest risk of developing the disease.\n\nPatricia has seen the debilitating effects of shingles up close \u2014 because her uncle suffered from the disease. She knows how crippling the condition can be. But thanks to the free vaccine provision in the Inflation Reduction Act \u2014 which was signed into law last year \u2014 she\u2019ll be better protected from getting sick and winding up in the hospital.\n\nI was proud to vote for the Inflation Reduction Act, because I\u2019m already hearing stories about Virginians who can now afford the preventative healthcare they need. And we are already seeing consequential savings and lower healthcare costs for families, small business owners, and seniors across our Commonwealth. One of my top priorities in Congress has been to lower costs for Virginians \u2014 and this law is delivering.\n\nBIDEN SIGNS $739 BILLION INFLATION REDUCTION ACT INTO LAW\n\nI\u2019ve also had many families reach out to my office, sharing their concerns about high insurance premiums at a time of high inflation and high stress. Thankfully, this law is now saving Virginians who buy private insurance on the Affordable Care Act exchanges an average of $970 in premiums this year. For many families, the amount saved is even higher: for example, a family of four in Spotsylvania County, Virginia (with two parents and two kids) is saving up to $2,800 on their premiums. And for a household with two adults over the age of 60 but not quite 65, who don\u2019t qualify for Medicare, the law saves up to $16,800 in premiums just this year alone.\n\nWhen it comes to saving Virginians money, perhaps the most far-reaching parts of this law are the reforms made to prescription drug coverage in Medicare. Here in Virginia, Medicare provides coverage to 1.5 million Virginia seniors and people living with disabilities.\n\nFor decades, Medicare enrollees struggled to afford prescriptions because of skyrocketing prices. I\u2019ve heard stories firsthand of Virginia seniors rationing medicine, skipping doses, getting into debt to afford prescriptions, taking expensive bus trips to Canada, or just going without them and risking the consequences.\n\nBut thankfully, the Inflation Reduction Act ends drug corporations' monopoly control over the prices of some of the most expensive and most used drugs in Medicare Part D. It gives Medicare the power to negotiate for lower prices. It caps out-of-pocket costs for Medicare beneficiaries at $2,000 per year. And it creates penalties for transnational pharmaceutical companies that raise their prices faster than the rate of inflation.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe bill also caps the price of insulin at $35 a month after a decade marked by rising prices that quadrupled out-of-pocket spending in Medicare between 2007 and 2020. A cap on this lifesaving medicine for Medicare enrollees is something we can all celebrate \u2014 regardless of political party \u2014 and one that I believe we should seek expand, so that Americans of all ages have guaranteed access to affordable insulin.\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act has lowered prescription drug cost and made vaccines free for Virginia\u2019s seniors, like Patricia. For decades, lawmakers in both parties promised to address soaring prices \u2014 only to never achieve the momentum necessary to make progress. But last year, we got it done. We held massive pharmaceutical companies accountable, we saved seniors money at the pharmacy counter, and \u2014 according to the nonpartisan CBO \u2014 we reduced the deficit by $237 billion over the next decade.\n\nAs some of my colleagues in Congress look to repeal the changes we\u2019ve made and reverse the cost-savings we\u2019ve seen here in Virginia for seniors like Patricia, I\u2019ll be pushing back against every effort to do so.

Altogether, a middle-class family of four could get $10,000 back, he said.\n\nThe Democratic governor's budget also includes lower taxes on Social Security income for more than 350,000 households, but not a complete elimination of the tax, as Republicans and some Democratic lawmakers had hoped. Social Security recipients with high overall incomes would still owe taxes on their benefits. But 43% of households receiving Social Security would save an average of $278 this year.\n\nThe tax cuts amount to $5.4 billion worth of relief, Budget Commissioner Jim Schowalter said.\n\nRepublican leaders were quick to blast the governor's plan for its big jump in overall spending from the $54 billion in the current budget, which runs through June, and for his unwillingness to use the record surplus to fully eliminate state taxes on Social Security at all income levels or permanently cut tax rates.\n\n\"We've got a surplus of $17.6 billion currently. This budget spends all of that. Not only that, but it grows government by 25%,\" Senate Minority Leader Mark Johnson, of East Grand Forks, told reporters.\n\n\"If we can't cut taxes now, when can we?\" asked House Minority Leader Lisa Demuth, of Cold Spring.\n\nThe surplus results from a combination of stronger-than-expected tax revenues and lower spending, which creates opportunities for a large amount of one-time spending, including the governor's proposed tax credits. But projected future revenue increases that could support ongoing spending or tax cuts are less.\n\nThe governor's budget proposal sets the stage for the main work of the 2023 legislative session. But his fellow Democrats, who now control both chambers, will have their own ideas about spending and tax priorities, and the final budget will be the product of committee hearings, floor debates and private negotiations over the next few months.\n\nInitial reaction from Democratic legislative leaders was positive, albeit noncommittal on the key specifics of the governor's budget.\n\n\"I commend the Governor for proposing a bold budget with an inspirational vision for our future,\" House Speaker Melissa Hortman, of Brooklyn Park, said in a statement. \"I look forward to our continued partnership as we craft our budget and pass legislation to build a Minnesota that works better for everyone.\"\n\n\"Governor Walz\u2019s budget reflects many of the priorities that Minnesotans told us they value, including proposals that will build an economy that works for everyone by lowering costs for families and ensuring strong schools, safe communities and a healthy climate,\" Senate Majority Leader Kari Dziedzic, of Minneapolis, said in a statement.\n\nWalz also proposed paying off the state's share of the debt on U.S. Bank Stadium, the home of the Minnesota Vikings, 22 years early. Revenues from electronic and paper pull-tab gambling \u2014 which are now earmarked for retiring stadium debt and are running stronger than first expected \u2014 would then go into the state's general fund, Schowalter said.\n\nMN GOV. WALZ PROPOSES $300M FOR PUBLIC SAFETY, $1B FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN BUDGET PLAN\n\nThe governor's budget also includes some tax increases that are sure to spark debate, including a bump in capital gains taxes for upper-income taxpayers and a payroll tax to fund a paid family and medical leave program that would take effect in 2026. Annual motor vehicle license tab renewal fees, which drop as a vehicle ages, would not rise but would fall more slowly.\n\nAn updated economic forecast expected in late February could result in adjustments. The Legislature must adjourn by May 22.\n\nThe session is already off to a fast start since it convened Jan. 3. Many top Democratic priorities are moving quickly through the legislative process, including several proposals blocked by the former GOP majority in the Senate over the last four years.\n\nThey include paid family and medical leave, legalization of recreational marijuana, climate change legislation to require that Minnesota utilities switch to carbon-free electricity by 2040 and a ban on so-called conversion therapy for LGBTQ youth.\n\nThe proposals also include funding for more prosecutors for the attorney general\u2019s office, making driver\u2019s licenses available regardless of immigration status, creation of an Office for Missing and Murdered Black Women and Girls, a prohibition against discrimination based on hairstyles, free school meals for all students and proposals to make voting easier, including restoring voting rights for felons when they get out of prison.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWalz signed his first bill just over a week into the session: A $100 million tax cut that brought the state tax code into conformity with federal rules.

This is something that must get done.\"\n\nDEMOCRATS PUSH TO ELIMINATE THE DEBT CEILING, ALLOW UNLIMITED GOVERNMENT BORROWING\n\nThe current stance taken by the White House, as well as Democrats who do not wish to work with Republicans over the debt limit, appears to go against prior remarks made by then-Vice President Joe Biden from 2011 to 2012 on negotiations surrounding the debt ceiling and how members of Congress should work together to reach \"certain compromises.\"\n\nIn May 2011, Biden, who played a role in deficit reduction and debt limit negotiations with the new Republican House majority that year, said he was \"really pleased and thankful\" to those who showed up to discuss the issues at a bipartisan meeting.\n\n\"I\u2019m really pleased and thankful all these guys showed up to begin the hard business of trying to deal with what\u2019s at hand here,\" Biden said at the time. \"This is an opening meeting where today I had a chance to talk a little bit with each of my colleagues. We\u2019re going to lay down not hard negotiating positions, but make sure each of us understand where the other guy is coming from.\"\n\nThree months later, in August 2011, Biden provided an update to reporters on negotiations with Republicans about raising the debt ceiling, insisting that the conversations at the time were essential in order to have a \"normal political battle\" about economic growth in the future.\n\nAmid pushback from progressive Democrats, as well as concern over the creation of jobs and growing the economy, Biden said the debt limit was \"used as the means by which, unless certain compromises were made, we would default on our debt.\"\n\n\"There is room within the budget, there\u2019s room within the budget to fund those priorities,\" he added at the time. \"But it\u2019s going to be, you know, what it ordinarily would be \u2014 a normal political battle. Rather than sitting there saying, \u2018by the way, if you don\u2019t do this, we\u2019re going to let the economy \u2014 the United States default.'\"\n\nThat same month, Biden criticized those who were \"unwilling to budge\" or took a \"my way or no way\" approach on the debt limit or deficit reduction.\n\n\"How can you explain the fact that grown men and women are unwilling to budge up till now, and still some of them are still unwilling to budge, by taking an absolute position: my way or no way. That`s not governing. That`s no way to govern. You can`t govern that way,\" Biden said during an interview with CBS News' Scott Pelley.\n\n\"I predict to you that a lot of those new members who came here with \u2018my way or the highway,\u2019 they`ll either be on the highway or they`ll learn that they have to have compromise,\" Biden added at the time.\n\nOne year later, in May 2012, Biden said it was a \"great honor\" to negotiate the debt ceiling with Republicans.\n\n\"I have had the great honor of spending hours and hours and hours, as you've covered my negotiating the debt limit and other things, with the leaders of the Republican Party,\" Biden said during an appearance on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"\n\nHOUSE CONSERVATIVE LEADER RIPS MEDIA FOR \u2018IRRATIONAL\u2019 DEBT CEILING COVERAGE, VOWS \u2018SERIOUS FISCAL REFORM\u2019\n\nEarlier this week, Democrat Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois told CNN's \"State of the Union\" anchor Dana Bash that Biden should \"absolutely not\" negotiate with Republicans about raising the debt ceiling.\n\n\"Those who are posing for holy pictures as budget balancers\u2026 should note one important fact: almost 25 percent of all of the national debt accumulated over the history of the United States\u2026 was accumulated during the four years of Donald Trump,\" Durbin said.\n\nIn contrast, moderate Democrat Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia said during a Sunday appearance on CNN that it's a \"mistake\" for Biden not to negotiate with Republicans about raising the debt limit.\n\n\"This is a democracy that we have,\" he said. \"We have a two-party system. And we should be able to talk and find out where our differences are. And if they are irreconcilable, then you have to move on from there and let the people make their decisions.\"\n\nDozens of House Democrats have proposed legislation that would eliminate the debt ceiling, which would allow the government to borrow without any limit set by Congress.\n\nThe federal government hit the $31.381 trillion debt ceiling last week, and House Republicans are pushing for commitments to cut back on the record growth in federal spending before agreeing to allow more borrowing. But Democrats accuse Republicans of setting up the possibility of prohibiting a debt ceiling hike, which would make the government unable to fund all of its current obligations.\n\nDemocrats say a better idea is to eliminate all limits on federal borrowing and allow the government to borrow whatever it needs.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHouse Speaker Kevin McCarthy said Friday that he will meet with President Biden to discuss increasing the debt ceiling.\n\n\"President Biden: I accept your invitation to sit down and discuss a responsible debt ceiling increase to address irresponsible government spending,\" the newly elected speaker tweeted Friday afternoon. \"I look forward to our meeting.\"\n\nBiden had said earlier on Friday that he and McCarthy would meet to discuss increasing the debt limit.\n\n\"We\u2019re going to have a little discussion on that,\" Biden said of McCarthy, Politico first reported. \"If we don\u2019t meet our national debt and renege for the first time, we have a calamity that exceeds anything that\u2019s ever happened financially in the United States.\"\n\nFox News' Peter Kasperowicz and Brie Stimson contributed to this article."}, {"title": "Here's how Republicans win the debt ceiling debate.

Speaker Kevin McCarthy and House Republicans should emphasize a few key points to win the support of the American people despite the bias of the media.\n\nThere are some key principles all Republicans can advocate to show problem solving leadership while they win the debt ceiling debate.\n\nRepublicans are for a responsible debt ceiling increase \u2013 and oppose an irresponsible debt ceiling increase. Passing another debt ceiling increase with no modifications to the current unsustainable spending and projected deficits would clearly be an example of an irresponsible debt ceiling increase.\n\nDEMOCRATS PUSH TO ELIMINATE THE DEBT CEILING, ALLOW UNLIMITED GOVERNMENT BORROWING\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office projects current spending would add $15.74 trillion to the deficit from now to 2032. So, it\u2019s clear the current spending model that Democrats have created is totally irresponsible. As CBO has warned since last decade, \"the current trajectory of federal borrowing is unsustainable and could lead to slower economic growth in the long run as debt rises as a percentage of GDP.\"\n\nIt is not unreasonable to demand rational cuts to spending. Even the Democrats know that in a nearly $6 trillion budget there are many items which can be cut without serious difficulties. The Joe Biden position of no negotiation is an insult to every American who believes the time for confrontation is over. We owe it to our children and our country\u2019s future to find a way to work together.\n\nOverwhelmingly, Americans believe government is too large and wasteful \u2013 and spending can be cut. Gallup found in 2014 that Americans on average think the federal government wastes 51 cents of every dollar.\n\nFurther, as our America\u2019s New Majority Project found in a January 2022 survey, by 58 percent to 26 percent, Americans say cutting wasteful spending and corruption would be enough to balance the federal budget. A follow-up survey found that by 67 percent to 29 percent Americans think limiting federal spending will reduce inflation.\n\nWe also found that 70 percent of Americans think we should have a constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget. (This includes 67 percent of Democrats, 70 percent of Independents, 74 percent of Republicans, 66 percent of Black voters, and 62 percent of Latino voters.) It doesn\u2019t get much more popular than this.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nAnd finally, a Scott Rasmussen National Survey found that 45 percent of Americans think we should only raise the debt ceiling if there are cuts to spending; 24 percent say we should raise the debt limit with no cuts; and 16 percent say it shouldn\u2019t be raised at all.\n\nImportantly, warning people of bad economic impacts if the debt ceiling is not increased has nearly no impact on their opinions.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that most Americans would be with a Republican House and Senate that demanded rational cuts to spending in exchange for the debt limit increase. Biden and the Democrats are simply testing whether they can push around the new Republican House majority.\n\nThere is little support for the Biden-Democrat argument that it is impossible to cut anything and there is no waste or corruption in Washington. Their base is approximately 20 percent to 25 percent.

Indeed, loans delinquent by more than two months increased by 5.3% in December compared to the prior month and skyrocketed by 26.7% from a year ago, according to recently released data from Cox Automotive.\n\nOf all December loans, 1.84% were severely delinquent (generally defined as more than 90 days behind on payments), marking an increase from 1.74% in November and the highest rate since February 2009, when the financial crisis crippled the the U.S. economy.\n\nKAMALA HARRIS REVEALS BIDEN'S 2023 PRIORITIES INCLUDES INFLATION, JOB GROWTH: 'NEVER BEEN MORE OPTIMISTIC'\n\nPeople with low credit scores and poor credit histories \u2014 those who received subprime auto loans \u2014 were especially behind on payments.\n\n\"In December, 7.11% of subprime loans were severely delinquent, increasing from 6.75% the prior month,\" Cox Automotive reported. \"The subprime severe delinquency rate was 163 basis points higher than a year ago, and the December rate was the highest in the data series back to 2006.\"\n\nDespite more people missing loan payments, however, defaults on loans have yet to experience a similar surge. Auto lenders generally don't consider the borrower to be in default until they're 90 to 120 days late of insufficient payments, indicating a potential surge in defaults in the coming months.\n\nNew figures showing people not making their car payments come as Americans are living paycheck to paycheck and not being able to afford basic necessities.\n\nAbout 72% of middle-income families say their earnings are falling behind the cost of living, according to a quarterly survey from Primeric report. A similar number, 74%, said they're unable to save for their future. Both figures are up from a year ago.\n\nPrices continue to remain high due to inflation, which reached a four-decade high last summer but has slowed over the last six months.\n\nAccording to the latest data, consumer inflation in December increased by 6.5% compared to the same time a year ago \u2014 the smallest 12-month increase since October 2021. Meanwhile, the inflation rate for producers in December rose 6.2% over the previous 12 months, the lowest level since March 2021.\n\n\"As inflation is coming down, take-home pay for workers is going up,\" Biden said in remarks on the economy earlier this month. \"Workers' wages are higher now than they were seven months ago, adjusted for inflation. Wages for lower-income and middle-income workers have gone up even more.

Grocery prices are up 11.8% year-over-year, while shelter costs are up 7.5% from a year ago.\n\nDespite Biden's comments, inflation has outpaced raw worker wages, which have consistently increased over the past two years under Biden. But when accounting for inflation, real average weekly earnings plummeted from December 2021 to last month by 3.1%, according to the Labor Department. Over the entirety of Biden's presidency, wages have cumulatively risen by 10% while inflation has risen cumulatively by 14%.\n\nExperts, including Rachel Greszler, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, calculate that this mismatch has cost the average household thousands of dollars.\n\n\"The Biden administration continues to tout high job gains throughout its tenure but fails to mention the large decline in workers' inflation-adjusted wages and the millions of Americans that are no longer working,\" Greszler wrote. \"Since January 2021, workers have lost $3,300 in wages due to inflation's $7,200 tax that has outstripped workers' $3,900 nominal wage gains.\"\n\nAs costs for necessities increase and households have less purchasing power, many Americans are forced to make tough choices.\n\nNearly one in five Americans (18%) said they skipped meals or didn't buy groceries due to high inflation over the past year, according to a Nationwide Retirement Institute survey. The data also showed that, due to inflation, many people canceled or postponed health plans in the past 12 months to see a specialist (14%), take a prescribed medication (10%), or get an annual physical (11%).\n\nMeanwhile, the data found 10% of adults have diverted funds from retirement savings to pay for health care expenses, and another 14% are considering doing so this year. Among Gen Z and Millennials, this figure is 21% and 20%, respectively.\n\nStill, Biden has touted the economy's performance, crediting his administration's policies for helping working and middle-class Americans.\n\n\"Now, two years in, it's clearer than ever that our plan is working. We're building the economy from the bottom up and the middle out.

And everybody \u2014 the poor have a shot, and the middle class can have a little breathing room.

On Oahu, the most populous island and where Honolulu is, the median price is more than $1 million.\n\nMany residents work in low-wage service jobs, and the financial strain is especially significant for Hawaii's Indigenous people. A state analysis published last year showed that a single person working 40 hours a week would need to earn $18 an hour to pay for housing and other necessities in Hawaii, but the state minimum wage is currently $12 an hour.\n\nMany, like the Purdys, have headed to Las Vegas.\n\nAccording to 2021 population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau, the biggest growth of Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander populations was in Clark County, Nevada, which includes Las Vegas, and Sacramento County, California.

Thanks to many other transplants, the Las Vegas area is full of restaurants catering to Hawaiian taste and cultural events expressing Hawaiian pride.\n\nThere\u2019s even a real estate brokerage that helps families relocate from the islands \u2014 run by mostly former Hawaii residents.\n\n\"You go into any store in any part of the valley and you'll find someone from Hawaii working there or shopping there,\" Purdy said.\n\nA three-bedroom home priced at $300,000 in a Las Vegas suburb would be $1.2 million in Honolulu, said Terry Nacion, a Native Hawaiian realtor. She left Hawaii for Las Vegas in 2003 because home ownership felt unattainable. \"Back home, you either had to have your home passed down to you or you have to work four jobs,\" she said.\n\nA few months after they moved, about 20 other relatives, including Purdy's mother, uncle and sister Lindsay Villarimo, followed them.\n\n\"Over time, it just became exhausting trying to make ends meet,\" said Villarimo. \"It's heartbreaking that's the choice we make. The majority of us, I think we just got priced out of home.\" When Villarimo and her family decided to move to Nevada, her husband Henry had never even left Hawaii.\n\nLas Vegas' affordability was \"liberating,\" she said.

Their daughter also got accepted to Kamehameha Schools, a highly selective and relatively affordable private school system that gives admissions preference to students with Hawaiian ancestry.\n\nThe family moved to Kapolei, a Honolulu suburb not far from where they once lived, to share a five-bedroom house with their extended family. Now that the Purdys have three children, they rent two of the bedrooms.\n\nPurdy is trying to find time to take his kids to hula lessons.

They negotiate salaries, benefits, and other school policies through the collective bargaining process. They take their funding, the vast share of which is spent on political causes, directly from teacher paychecks. They roll over teacher membership year after year without any action from the teacher.\n\nThe devastation wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic opened parents\u2019 eyes to the unions\u2019 abuse of these privileges. Now, leaders like Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida are showing the grit required to take on entrenched interest groups and reduce their unwarranted influence over America\u2019s schools.\n\nCapitalizing on his recent drubbing of pro-teacher union gubernatorial candidate Charlie Crist and dozens of anti-education freedom school board candidates, Governor DeSantis announced to Florida school board members and future candidates in December an ambitious \"Freedom Blueprint\" that would disrupt public K\u201312 schools\u2019 cozy relationships with unions and restore to teachers the agency to decide whether they wish to join or remain with these unaccountable, ideologically driven interest groups.\n\nIf enacted, DeSantis\u2019s proposals would raise teacher pay while stymying union bosses from siphoning these funds out of teachers\u2019 pockets and into their own coffers. Schools would no longer be permitted to fund unions directly out of teachers\u2019 paychecks. Unions would need permission from teachers each year to keep them on their membership roll. To restrain \"zombie\" unions that no longer enjoy widespread teacher support from terrorizing students and parents, the blueprint would require that unions represent over 50 percent of teachers to engage in collective bargaining with a district.\n\nRON DESANTIS'S \u2018FREEDOM BLUEPRINT\u2019 TOUTED BY SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS AS WAY TO ELECT MORE CONSERVATIVE CANDIDATES\n\nDeSantis explained that his proposals would prevent money intended for hardworking teachers from being \"frittered away by interest groups.\" The blueprint \"maximizes freedom to choose\" among teachers to decide what to do with the money they earn.\n\nThis blueprint could not come at a better time to repel the unprecedented attempts of teacher unions to wrest control of the education system from parents and transform our schools into laboratories of progressive social and cultural experimentation. Union bosses are publicly touting their indoctrination of educators in gender ideology and critical race theory through \"professional development\" sessions, including \"drag queen story hours,\" and summer reading lists that force upon children the false choice of becoming an \"ally\" or an \"accomplice\" in the culture wars.\n\nAt their annual meetings last year, the National Education Association (NEA) and the American Federation of Teachers (AFT)\u2014the two largest national teacher unions\u2014adopted resolutions that, among other things, condemned the ideal of colorblindness as a basis for school policies; attacked state legislation restricting the teaching of gender ideology to young children and preventing biological men who identify as women from participating in women\u2019s athletics; and required the integration of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) factors in decisions about the investment of teachers\u2019 retirement funds.\n\nMy Defense of Freedom Institute for Policy Studies (DFI) report reveals how teacher union bosses are insidiously using the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements\u2014in woke-filled back rooms that avoid public debate and scrutiny\u2014as opportunities to embed their strident political wish lists in school district policies.\n\nHere are just a few examples:\n\nThe Detroit Federation of Teachers has negotiated with Detroit Public Schools the creation of a \"School Equity Lead Supplemental Position,\" a qualification for which is completion of a summer \"anti-racism\" course, to train educators how to teach students in a \"culturally responsive\" manner\u2014meaning that every teacher must tailor their lesson plans arbitrarily to the perceived ethnicity and culture of each of their students.\n\nThe Montgomery County, Maryland, school district\u2019s contract with the Montgomery County Education Association requires schools seeking to discipline their students to engage in so-called \"restorative practices,\" including \"mental wellness approaches,\" \"social skills development,\" and \"a thoughtful problem-solving approach that focuses on \u2018why\u2019 a student may be exhibiting inappropriate behavior(s)\"\u2014translating the excessively lenient approach of progressive city prosecutors to the classroom in a way that will inevitably encourage more misbehavior and classroom disruption to the detriment of student learning.\n\nLast spring, the Minneapolis Federation of Teachers insisted on the inclusion of terms labeled \"Protections for Educators of Color\" in a deal to end a teacher strike. These provisions illegally and unconstitutionally require the school district, when engaged in layoffs, to fire white teachers before it fires any \"member of a population underrepresented among licensed teachers in the District.\" The agreement also requires the school district to grant minority educators access to resources and trainings as \"additional supports\" not granted to white teachers.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nAs these and many other collective bargaining agreements outlined in my DFI report reveal, teacher unions no longer resemble the teachers that they supposedly represent, but are now political creatures that perpetuate themselves by feeding on teacher salaries and special privileges from states and school systems. Teachers stand to lose, and lose big, from union-imposed straitjackets dictating their teaching style, narrowing the permissible approaches to classroom discipline, and requiring their attendance at tedious trainings that aim to turn them and their students into \"anti-racist\" social justice warriors. Reining in teacher union privileges and resources stands to benefit teachers, just as it would enhance the freedom of students and parents to choose the education that is right for them.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn the face of threats to teaching and learning posed by these powerful special interest groups, governors and legislators across the nation would be wise to xerox Governor DeSantis\u2019s Freedom Blueprint and use it to fight back against teacher union influence over school operations and policies in their home states.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM PAUL ZIMMERMAN"}, {"title": "KY vendor accidently collects twice from 7,000 tax accounts", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/ky-vendor-accidently-collects-twice-7000-tax-accounts", "tag": "KENTUCKY", "content": "A vendor collecting taxes for the sthttps://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/kentuckyate of Kentucky accidentally collected twice from more than 7,000 accounts on Wednesday.\n\nKentucky Department of Revenue spokesperson Jill Midkiff called the problem a \"technical glitch.\" The department has instructed private vendor Kentucky Interactive to identify the source of the glitch so it does not happen again, Midkiff told the Lexington Herald-Leader.

The documentary features four individuals in their work environment as they get candid about why they chose trade school over college.\n\nFox, the actress, director, and philanthropist known for her iconic roles in \"Kill Bill,\" \"Independence Day\" and more, shared that her personal connections to skilled trade individuals and the work they do make her \"proud.\"\n\n\"I'm all about girl power, and I'm very proud of a couple of my girlfriends that are in the trade positions like my girlfriends Vanessa and Alicia,\" Fox told Fox News Digital. \"They are a mother and daughter duo that drive forklifts in Detroit.

While it may not be glamorous, Knowles said she had followed her passion in plumbing in part because she had been fascinated to learn more about water and how it \"starts somewhere and gets to your house.\"\n\n\"You kind of take it granted,\" she says in the film. \"Because you turn that sink on and water's always coming.\"\n\nEach individual featured in the documentary had a unique reason for wanting to pursue their skilled trade.

I'm having success in my career beyond my wildest dreams. Being a producer, a director, an author. Doing things that people said I could never do, so I was really proud to see those ladies that, you know, studying up those naysayers. That's what I call that, that, 'Please don't put me in a box.' If I say I'm going to do it, allow me the opportunity to do it.\"\n\nSome argue that the only way to truly get ahead in life and career, is to get one's hands on a college degree. Fox said she understood the argument and stressed the importance of education, but said people should know they have options.\n\n\"That's not a bad misconception, but it's not available to everyone,\" Fox said about college. \"And when I say that financially, everyone can't afford to go through college and then, you know, go and get their MBAs and all other things like that. So some of us got to take shortcuts. Because either we become young mothers or financially, our family just can't afford it.\"\n\n\"So, yes, I would love to see women now holding positions as doctors, lawyers, Supreme Court judges, through education,\" she added. \"I mean, I always want to stress education, please.

It has the appearance that someone would have taken them and moved them around. I mean, this is very concerning. Hopefully, that the Secret Service is going to work with us. We're requesting tomorrow formally any type of correspondence, any type of emails, any type of documentation that would help us determine who actually had access to those documents. And hopefully the Secret Service will work with us despite the fact that this White House is not.\n\nMaria Bartiromo So just to be clear, you are sending letters tomorrow morning, formal letters to the Secret Service to request information on who had information about those documents. And we just showed a picture of the diamond, 3.2 carat diamond that Hunter Biden accepted from Chinese officials. This we know from the laptop. We know that there are ways to hide wealth in diamonds because you don't have to put it in a will. You don't have to pay taxes. You just give it to somebody else. He accepted this diamond. What powers are left to combat this?\n\nCongressman James Comer (R-KY) Look, you know, we know a lot more about the diamond than I need to talk about right now. You know, that Diamond was given to Hunter at about the time these documents were being transported to different locations. It's very concerning. You know, two ways the Chinese tried to launder money into the United States are through the art world and through diamonds. Do you see a connection here, Maria? I mean, this is very concerning. And I think the good thing for our investigation with respect to how the mainstream media covers the mainstream media can sit there and look at Jean-Pierre and tell that she's not being truthful with the American people. They had that Ian Sams come up yesterday and had a press conference, and he talked about everything. But the fact that they had found additional documents. And why didn't he say that at that press conference? He has no credibility. The White House isn't being truthful with the American people. We need to know now who had access to those documents because our national security could be at risk.\n\nMaria Bartiromo Well, is this treason?\n\nCOMER WILL 'CONTINUE TO PRESS' FOR INFO ON BIDEN DOCS SCANDAL AFTER WHITE HOUSE SAYS NO VISITOR LOGS IN DE\n\nCongressman James Comer (R-KY) It's very concerning. We're not going to let up. I think that we've got plenty of information to move forward. This would be a lot easier if the White House would work with us. But not only are they stonewalling our investigation, you know, they're constantly if you watch that press conference with the NSA guy they brought in to fight back against the investigators, which is preposterous because this is the oversight committee. We're supposed to provide oversight to the government in the executive branch.\n\nNEWT GINGRICH CALLS BIDEN\u2019S FAMILY BUSINESS DEALINGS LIKE \u2018THE SOPRANOS\u2019\n\nMaria Bartiromo President Biden also sent some documents to the University of Delaware. What do we know about that? We know that China sent money to the University of Pennsylvania. What about the University of Delaware?\n\nMORE CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS FOUND AT BIDEN'S HOME WEEK AFTER WHITE HOUSE SAID SEARCH WAS 'COMPLETE'\n\nNewt Gingrich Well, the University of Delaware has kept everything totally secret and even had a state judge condemn them for their secrecy. We have no idea where the money comes from. And by the way, in terms of looking for documents, there are 1850 boxes and several hundred electronic documents that Biden transferred to the University of Delaware. I don't know that anybody has begun to look through those boxes which were theoretically sealed. But you need to look at them to find out are there any classified documents in that 1850 boxes, plus several hundred electronic documents that were transferred there? No one knows who's given money to the University of Delaware, how much money they have given. They have a Biden center just like the University of Pennsylvania. As you point out, we know that the Chinese communist are in for well over $50 million at the University of Pennsylvania. And that produced, of course, the ambassador to Germany and the ambassador to Canada out of the senior leadership of the University of Pennsylvania. So I really do believe these are The Sopranos. I think part of the reason that Congressman James Comer is going to have a really hard time is they have no interest in cooperating. Everything they reveal is going to make them weaker and going to make them guiltier. I mean, I actually don't know. You may know this. Where is the diamond? I mean, if there's a diamond that big hanging around, who has it? Yeah, it was reported as government property. I mean, that was reported on the taxes.

You know, you think about this. They've been wrecking economies all over the world. I mean, they fly to Davos and what's the carbon footprint, by the way, of all these global elitist liberals flying in their private jets to Davos to tell you to change your lifestyle, you know, and then they want to go after industries. They want to kill the oil and gas industry. By the way, did they have solar panels on the wings of their airplanes when they flew to Davos? No, they use jet fuel yet they want to kill these industries. And all they're doing is empowering foreign countries. They're making our country more reliant on foreign countries, whether it's OPEC nations, Russia, Iran. Why would we be doing that when if you want to save the planet, make more things in America. We do it better than anybody else in the world. They need to start recognizing that drop all this woke agenda that's killing Americans. And it's raising it, by the way, it's raising prices on those lowest income Americans who can least afford it. So, you know, this idea of this woke America. I think people are rejecting it. People are fed up with it and they see that it's raising their costs on everything from electricity in their house, not only gas at the pump, but everything they buy and all just to push jobs to China. Who's building a new coal plant every single week? This is lunacy. It's got to end, and we're going to be putting scrutiny on it.\n\nSEN JOE MANCHIN (D-WV) TELLS MARIA BARTIROMO THAT THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION\u2019S PROPOSED RULES ON EVs ARE DEPENDENT ON CHINESE SUPPLY CHAINS\n\nMARIA BARTIROMO When do you expect to get the energy security?\n\nSENATOR JOE MANCHIN We're watching very closely right now is how the administration and their agencies are starting to put the rules. I have a big disagreement with Treasury right now and Secretary Yellen. I respect her immensely. She's a friend. But the way they're proposing the rules on EVs, Maria, what they were doing, this administration, and let's say what they want is to switch to EVs. That's fine. It's a wonderful vehicle. People love them. The bottom line is we were going to change our transportation mode for the first time in history, United States of America, and depend and be reliable on foreign supply chains, mainly China, for the anodes and cathodes that make the battery manufacturing the battery. So I said, if we're going to do that, then I'm not in, I'm not voting for this. But if you want to develop a battery manufacturing and sourcing of rare earth minerals from North America and from our free trading agreement countries that we have, then we have control that we don't have to worry about supply chains being cut.

So I remember talking with you throughout 2017, \u201818, \u201919 about classified documents that you were viewing. Tell us the process. How is it possible that Joe Biden was able to take classified documents out of the White House, out of these secure locations and put them everywhere, including in Chinatown and D.C. before landing at the Penn Biden Center?\n\nBILL MAHER ADMITS BIDEN WAS 'VERY SHADY' WITH DOCUMENTS, BUT SAYS HIS SCANDAL IS 'DIFFERENT' THAN TRUMP'S\n\nDEVIN NUNES Well, the quick answer is it's not possible unless you're breaking the law. So, you know, if we had to move a document from the House Intelligence Committee to, say, the Senate Intelligence Committee, which would happen often if we were exchanging letters, that document had to be put into a pouch, locked up, carried by someone who had classification authority and then moved over to the Senate side where we could go and have a meeting, we could discuss whatever document it is. So there's a lot of unanswered questions here. And if you look back to how this all began, this started in 2021 when somebody at the archives decided, hey, we got a plan to get Trump. He's got some documents, we think. So there was a back and forth, back and forth. And then people at the higher echelons of the DOJ and the Biden White House, who desperately want to get rid of Trump, decided to concoct this plan that, hey, if we go to a judge, get a warrant, send in guns, blazing sirens and go into Mar a Lago, the American people will say, we're not going to do that. You know, this is, Trump's done. Well, what happened is the American people said, no, this is third-world garbage that's occurring in this country and they've rejected it."}, {"title": "Scalise shames Washington spending spree: A \u2018drunken sailor\u2019 would do better", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/media/scalise-shames-washington-spending-spree-drunken-sailor-would-do-better", "tag": "ECONOMY", "content": "House Majority Leader Steve Scalise joined \u2018Sunday Morning Futures' to react to the U.S. reaching the debt limit earlier this week and highlighted Joe Biden's handling of the economy and federal spending spree.

Employees will also feel less comfortable asking questions and expressing themselves in front of a group, if they receive the chance at all,\" added Jorgensen.\n\nShe also said, \"Employees can feel blindsided. While many employees are aware of layoffs in a group Zoom, the practice remains unpopular.\"\n\nCAREER CHALLENGE: HERE ARE THE SMARTEST WAYS TO TRANSITION SMOOTHLY TO A NEW MANAGER\n\nShe said that \"unless management has shared the content of the call ahead of time, employees will be caught by surprise when what seems like a typical team call becomes a group firing.\"\n\nDid remote work due to COVID increase Zoom firings?\n\nWith today's remote work setups, more and more crucial conversations are taking place over Zoom or in a virtual space, noted Jorgensen.\n\n\"Pre-pandemic, these conversations typically took place face-to-face, but the business world has now embraced video calls as an effective way to communicate about job offers, HR updates and more. These factors have forced disciplinary action to also occur via Zoom.\"\n\nJorgensen distinguished between Zoom firings in group settings \u2014 and dismissals via Zoom that are one-on-one.\n\nShe said that today, \"for fully remote employees, layoffs or firings must take place on Zoom or similar platforms.\"\n\nShe also said, \"Managers can have difficult conversations via a video call, but it is important for employers to recognize the value of one-on-one communication around this topic.\"\n\nWhat can people do to brace themselves for a Zoom dismissal?\n\nEmployees can \"remind themselves that a company\u2019s choice to fire someone over Zoom is a reflection of them, not you,\" Morin said.\n\nJorgensen, for her part, said that ideally, the employer has been transparent about the state of business.\n\n\"When employees are aware of any challenges the company is facing \u2014 which have been exacerbated by a variety of other global factors \u2014 they need to be realistic about what could happen to their job role.\"\n\nWORKPLACE BULLYING: HOW TO RECOGNIZE IT, HOW TO HANDLE IT\n\nShe added, \"When an employee realizes layoffs could be on the horizon, it is the ideal time to reconnect with past colleagues, update resumes and begin to look at job postings. This prep work allows employees to jump back into the job market quickly if layoffs should occur.\"\n\n\"It is the ideal time to reconnect with past colleagues, update resumes and begin to look at job postings.\"\n\nJorgensen also noted that the way employers handle layoffs is important.\n\n\"When handled correctly, the organization has a pool of candidates to pick from when hiring resumes,\" said Jorgensen.\n\nLONELINESS AND UNHAPPINESS CAN AGE US FASTER THAN SMOKING: NEW STUDY\n\n\"Additionally, those who are still within the organization remain engaged.

The bill is an attempt to ensure all federal regulations are legally initiated and issued by federal officials who are Senate-confirmed and thus more accountable to American voters.\n\nCline said too many regulations are released by minor agency officials, which has led to myriad new rules that contribute to soaring federal mandates, which he said costs 10% of America\u2019s gross domestic product each year.\n\nBIDEN REGULATIONS COST THE ECONOMY $309B IN FIRST TWO YEARS, UP FROM OBAMA'S $204B\n\n\"The problem is across the board,\" Cline told Fox News Digital. \"It\u2019s just in varying degrees, depending on which agency you\u2019re dealing with.\"\n\nThe bill is a response to a 2019 study by the Pacific Legal Foundation, which found that 98% of all rules that came out of the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) between 2001 and 2017 were issued \"illegally\" by non-Senate confirmed officials and that other agencies had similar problems. The study found that 25 of those rules had an economic impact of more than $100 million and that the FDA\u2019s high incidence of rules issued by minor officials meant that more than 70% of all HHS rules were \"unconstitutional.\"\n\nJoe Luppino-Esposito, deputy legal policy director at the foundation, said his group has been involved in lawsuits against federal rules that are not issued properly, which has forced some agencies to go back and get sign-off from appointed officials.\n\nBIDEN ADMINISTRATION BOATING PROPOSAL WOULD BE \u2018GREATEST REGULATORY OVERREACH\u2019 OF ITS KIND, CRITICS WARN\n\nThe legal theory underpinning this effort is that the Constitution\u2019s Appointments Clause requires senior appointed officials to impose regulatory burdens on Americans, a view the foundation says has been supported by a few Supreme Court cases: Buckley v.

The foundation says those cases backed the idea that \"only principal agency officers (like department heads and assistant secretaries confirmed by the Senate) may issue regulations that have the force of law.\"\n\nLuppino-Esposito said the bipartisan nature of Cline\u2019s bill shows that \"people on both sides of the aisle are recognizing\" the problem of ceding too much authority to minor, unknown officials who aren\u2019t directly accountable to the people.\n\nCline said he and Golden joined the House Problem Solvers\u2019 Caucus at the same time and that they both agree on the need to address this growing issue.\n\nAOC FIRES BACK AT \u2018REPUBLICAN MELTDOWN\u2019 OVER GAS STOVES: \u2018THERE IS VERY CONCERNING SCIENCE\u2019\n\n\"We both share an outlook on overreaching executive branch authority, and I think we\u2019re trying to solve a problem here that\u2019s gotten \u2026 to be a significant program and is affecting the daily lives of Americans,\" he said.\n\nCline also predicted that new House Republican leadership would be interested in moving the bill soon.\n\n\"Leadership is going to be interested in setting down markers on overreaching by the executive branch, and so they\u2019ve looked to bills like this one that have statistics and facts and figured to back them up, so hopefully we\u2019ll see this move fairly early,\" he said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nUnder the bill, most federal rules would have to be \"issued and signed by an individual appointed by the president, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.\" The bill also holds that rules must be initiated by these senior officials."}, {"title": "UK town to switch off streetlights after midnight to save energy despite crime concerns, hike taxes: report", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/uk-town-switch-off-streetlights-midnight-save-energy-crime-taxes-report", "tag": "UNITED KINGDOM", "content": "A draft budget in the U.K. city of Newport is proposing to switch off streetlights to cut back on costs, but officials are concerned that the move would put residents at risk.\n\nThe city, located in South Wales, included the measure in its 2023/2024 draft budget.

Government officials have also publicly said they would like to see a weaker ruble - something the foreign currency interventions seem likely to prevent.\n\nAnalysts at Alfa Bank said it was \"puzzling\" the finance ministry would restart FX sales while the Kremlin is also aiming for a weaker ruble.\n\nRussia's budget for this year is based on a Urals blend price of around $70.10 a barrel, though Russia's main blend is currently trading at around $50 a barrel.\n\nIn rubles, that is a two-year low, according to Reuters calculations.\n\n\"If the relatively low prices for Urals last for a long time, and the ruble remains relatively strong, then the budget hole will inflate,\" said Anton Tabakh, Chief Economist of RA Expert.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nState-owned bank Sberbank estimates that if the average price for Russia's Urals blend was $55 per barrel, and the ruble continued trading around 67 against the U.S. dollar, the government will be required to sell $1.5 billion \u2014 or 100 billion rubles \u2014 of foreign exchange holdings every month to cover the gap."}, {"title": "Eco group slams Davos summit as global elites arrive in private jets to talk climate policy", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/eco-group-slams-davos-summit-global-elite-arrive-private-jets-talk-climate-policy", "tag": "CLIMATE CHANGE", "content": "Greenpeace International, a global climate group that opposes fossil fuels, released a study showing that elites largely travel to the World Economic Forum's (WEF) annual conference via private jets.\n\nThe analysis \u2013 published late last week by Greenpeace and the environmental research firm CE Delft \u2013 showed that there was a significant uptick in private jet flights, many of which were short-distance, to airports near WEF's headquarters in Davos, Switzerland, during the 2022 summit.

Tim Walz signed his first bill of the 2023 session Thursday, legislation to simplify tax filing and save money for hundreds of thousands of Minnesota residents and businesses, including people with student loans and companies that received pandemic aid.\n\nThe bill brings Minnesota's tax code into conformity with federal tax rules. It's one of several that legislative leaders have fast-tracked since convening last week with Democrats now controlling both chambers of the Legislature. Bills on issues from abortion rights to unemployment benefits for laid-off miners are also expected to hit the governor's desk soon.\n\nThe tax conformity bill sailed through both the House and Senate with unanimous bipartisan support. Officials said it needed to be signed into law by Friday so that tax forms and software could be updated in time for the filing season, which opens Jan. 23.\n\nMN DEMOCRATS EXCEED EXPECTATIONS IN THIS YEAR'S MIDTERM ELECTIONS WITH WINS IN BOTH HOUSES OF LEGISLATURE\n\n\"This is the way the Legislature's supposed to work,\" Walz said at a signing ceremony.\n\nIt amounts to over a $100 million tax cut, and it's retroactive, so individuals and businesses who qualify can file amended returns for previous years to claim refunds. Over 600,000 individuals and businesses will benefit, said Senate Taxes Committee Chair Ann Rest, of New Hope. The Department of Revenue has posted information on its website detailing who the changes affect.\n\nThe bill ensures that federal coronavirus, economic stimulus and other aid passed in recent years that's exempt from federal taxation won't be subject to state taxes. That means a retroactive state tax break for numerous businesses that got grants to keep them afloat while they were shut down during the height of the pandemic.\n\n\"For the first time in almost three years, Minnesota's small businesses, venues, movie theaters, restaurants \u2014 those of us that were the first to close and the last to reopen \u2014 can breathe a tiny sigh of relief,\" said Dayna Frank, president and CEO of First Avenue Productions, which owns the iconic First Avenue nightclub in Minneapolis.\n\nIt also ensures that forgiven student loans won't be taxable by the state if President Joe Biden's relief program survives a challenge that will reach the U.S. Supreme Court next month.\n\nThe Legislature had hoped to pass a similar package last year, but it got caught up in partisan stalemates that resulted in most of a $9.25 billion budget surplus going unspent. That projected surplus has since swelled to $17.6 billion, so there was plenty of money available for conformity.\n\nAlso moving quickly through both chambers is a bill to codify abortion rights, which passed its final House committee Thursday and could get a floor vote as soon as next week. It's a top priority for Democrats, who hope Walz can sign it by the end of the month.\n\nAbortion rights remained broadly protected in Minnesota even after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade. That's due to a 1995 Minnesota Supreme Court decision. But the bill would write those protections into state statutes to prevent future courts from reversing them.\n\nMINNESOTA LEGISLATURE HOLDS HEARING REGARDING THE LEGALIZATION OF RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA FOR ADULTS\n\nSimilarly, a bill to remove several abortion restrictions from Minnesota statutes, which a state judge struck down as unconstitutional last summer, passed its first committee Thursday in the House.\n\nOne of the newest members of the Legislature, Democratic Sen. Grant Hauschild, of Hermantown, is the lead author of what could be one of the next bills to reach the governor. Hauschild narrowly carried his northeastern Minnesota district in November in one of a handful of races that tipped control of the Senate to the Democrats.\n\nHis bill, which passed the Senate 56-10 Thursday, would extend unemployment benefits for more than 400 laid-off workers at Northshore Mining. The operation has been idle since May 1. The main reason is a royalty dispute between its owner, Cleveland-Cliffs, and a trust that controls the mineral rights for the mine pit near Babbitt that supplies iron ore for Northshore's processing plant in Silver Bay. Jobless benefits typically run out after six months in Minnesota, so the bill would extend them for another six months, retroactively, at a cost of $10.3 million.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThat bill now goes to the House, where a first hearing is set for Wednesday.

However, it did refer to a legitimate public policy concern. For years, the Department of Energy (DOE) had restrictions in place limiting the water usage of home appliances \u2013 not least among them were dishwashers. And, thus, one of Donald Trump\u2019s last acts as president was to have DOE create rules to allow a new, legal class of more efficient dishwashers.\n\nThe logic was very simple. From 1983 to 2018, the average wash cycle time in the U.S. more than doubled from 69 minutes to 140 minutes. While, the appliances used less water, they ran for twice the time and did not perform as well. Naturally, 98 percent of the 2,244 people who submitted comments to the Trump DOE\u2019s regulatory docket supported the proposal for the legalization of these new dishwashers. It was a commonsense proposal that would save American consumers time \u2013 and ultimately money.\n\nSadly, the Biden administration quickly did away with this rule change, reverting back to the old DOE standards. This once again relegated Americans to choosing between hand-washing their dishes one at a time \u2013 which would likely use as much, if not more, water \u2013 or running wash cycles that would take twice as long and even then might not get the job done.\n\nNow, it seems the Biden administration\u2019s war on convenience in the home is far from over. The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has reportedly been weighing a rule that would ban gas stoves nationwide. This comes after prompting by Democrat Sen. Cory Booker and Democrat Rep. Don Beyer, who urged the agency to do something about gas stoves, claiming they are a \"cumulative burden\" on minority and low-income households.\n\nBIDEN ADMIN TORCHED BY REP. GARY PALMER OVER POTENTIAL GAS STOVE BAN\n\nThis gas stove ban would be the latest proposed action being done in the name of protecting the vulnerable, while actually going after their way of life in a very tangible way. Despite reports that the agency is walking back this plan, it is far from out of character for this administration.\n\nArguments in favor of a ban are fairly deceptive. On average, gas stoves are 10 to 30 percent less expensive than their electric counterparts. So, yes, low-income communities do utilize gas stoves more frequently than the more financially advantaged classes. However, this also means that gas stoves are a more affordable alternative for low-income communities and \u2013 without them \u2013 they will be pressed even harder economically. A ban on gas stoves would act as a backdoor tax on those who would have to switch to more expensive models.\n\nThe data on which this newfound interest in gas stoves by the federal government stands on shaky ground. In December, the International Journal of Environmental Research (IJER) and Public Health published a meta-analysis, examining the link between childhood asthma and gas stoves in the home. The study analyzed 27 other manuscripts on the subject and combined the results. This is despite the fact that a similar meta-analysis was performed in 2013, which used 41 studies, indicating the IJER analysis may have selectively chosen its data.\n\nAlso, the primary author of the IJER meta-analysis works for the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI), a special interest group based in Colorado, which describes itself as a \"non-partisan, non-profit organization that works to transform global energy systems across the real economy\u2026 powering our homes and businesses without fossil fuels.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nRMI also received a 4.4 million dollar grant from the Department of Energy. According to Influence Watch, RMI\u2019s top donors are dedicated left-wing groups like the Bloomberg Family Foundation, the Oak Foundation, and the ClimateWorks Foundation. Despite this, IJER cites no potential conflicts of interest in its analyses and conclusions.\n\nSimply, there are a number of reasons American consumers would select a gas stove over an electric one. Gas stovetops give instant heat and have the ability to make immediate temperature changes while cooking. The stovetops are also more sturdy and compatible with a variety of cookware. This makes gas stoves more practical for restaurants as well. A ban could severely damage the business models of many independently owned restaurants, driving up costs which would either increase meal prices or \u2013 at worst \u2013 put them out of business.\n\nWhatever the reason, consumers and restaurants should be free to make the choices best for them, knowing and weighing the potential risks on their own. The Biden administration should stay true to latest reports and stay far away from any sort of ban on these appliances."}, {"title": "GOP Chair Stefanik pushes bill to rein in Biden policies fueling inflation \u2018fire\u2019", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-chair-stefanik-pushes-bill-rein-biden-policies-fueling-inflation-fire", "tag": "HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES", "content": "EXCLUSIVE: House Republicans led by GOP Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik are pushing a bill to hold the Biden administration accountable for any action it takes that may contribute to inflation.\n\nThe \"REIN IN Inflation Act\" would require the Biden administration take into account inflation before enacting any executive action and improve its communication and transparency with Congress.\n\nIt would require an inflation report by the Office of Management and Budget and the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors for any action estimated to cost over $1 billion.\n\nStefanik, R-N.Y., is joined by House Ways and Means Committee Chair Jason Smith, R-Mo., House Oversight Commitee Chair James Comer, R-Ky., and House Committee on Financial Services Chair Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., as co-sponsors to the bill.\n\nWHAT'S IN IT: HOUSE GOP RULES PACKAGE AIMS TO CURB TRILLIONS IN YEARLY HEAPS OF NEW DEBT\n\nThe lawmakers introduced similar legislation last Congress, but now that Republicans have the majority in the House, they are hopeful the Biden administration will be held to account.

It is about telling the American people the federal government knows best and will decide what kind of car they can drive, how they can heat their house, and now how they\u2019re allowed to cook food for their families,\" Rodgers said. \"Natural gas is critical for millions of Americans. Forcing people to switch to expensive alternatives will only further increase costs on hardworking American families while disproportionately harming the most vulnerable in our communities.\"\n\n\"Energy and Commerce Republicans will hold President Biden accountable for his war on American energy and bring down energy costs,\" she added.\n\nRep. Blaine Luetkemeyer, a Republican representing Missouri's 3rd Congressional District, told Fox that the reported consideration to ban gas stoves is \"another far-left policy with zero regard for the people it affects.\"\n\n\"Gas stoves are an affordable option that are used by close to 40% of households in Missouri and across America,\" said Luetkemeyer, who has served as a ranking member on the House Small Business Committee. \"The fact that the administration is more focused on controlling how Americans cook their food rather than whether people can actually afford it proves yet again how out of touch the president and the activists working for him really are.\"\n\nSen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., also blasted the reported move in a statement on Tuesday, saying it is \"a recipe for disaster.\"\n\n\"The federal government has no business telling American families how to cook their dinner. I can tell you the last thing that would ever leave my house is the gas stove that we cook on,\" Manchin said. \"If this is the greatest concern that the Consumer Product Safety Commission has for American consumers, I think we need to reevaluate the commission.\"\n\nOther House Republicans \u2014 including Reps. Daniel Meuser of Pennsylvania, Jim Banks of Indiana and Claudia Tenney of New York \u2014 expressed distaste with potential move.\n\nMeuser told Fox that the move could result in \"Americans paying higher electric bills and strain our electric grid even further.\"\n\n\"The Biden administration\u2019s government overreach has now found its way into Americans\u2019 kitchens with this announcement to potentially ban gas stoves by an obscure federal agency, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission,\" Meuser said. \"More than a third of Americans use natural gas stoves in their homes. Banning the use of these appliances in Americans' homes is just the continuation of the Biden administration\u2019s unfounded attacks on American energy.\"\n\n\"This decision could lead to Americans paying higher electric bills and strain our electric grid even further,\" Meuser added. \"As the representative of one of the highest natural gas producing regions in the country, I am once again dismayed by these proposals. Natural gas is among the cleanest, safest, most affordable and abundant form of energy in the United States. Discouraging its use by banning gas stoves is a perplexing and misguided policy.\"\n\nBIDEN WHITE HOUSE SAYS IT DOES NOT SUPPORT GAS STOVE BAN\n\nSimilarly, Banks suggested that gas stoves are safer than electric stoves and said banning gas stoves is a part of the \"Left\u2019s radical green agenda\" and has to do with \"control, not science.\"\n\nTenney, who has also served as a member of the House Small Business Committee, said the reported move \"once again proves the Left is only concerned with controlling the lives of others, not with improving the quality of life of Americans.\"\n\n\"Gas stoves are used in over 40 million homes across the country, and this recent attempt by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and Kathy Hochul to force businesses and families to use electric stoves is just another battle in Democrats\u2019 war on reliable and affordable energy options,\" Tenney said. \"Consumers should be able to choose how they cook their food, heat their homes and power their cars, and they should be able to do it affordably.\"\n\nNoting that the idea to ban gas stoves is \"unrealistic,\" GOP Rep. Michael Burgess of Texas told Fox that the reported move is \"a classic example of junk science.\"\n\n\"Gas is a very efficient way of cooking and heating homes, and Americans have been using these stoves for decades with no major complications,\" Burgess said. \"Gas stoves are affordable, practical and popular. Democrats are simply grasping at straws to push their Green New Deal agenda. Americans who are already suffering under record-high inflation can already barely afford to heat their homes this winter, and now the Biden administration wants them to go out and buy a new stove. It\u2019s out of touch and unrealistic.\"\n\nOffering a more relaxed perspective on the issue, GOP Rep. Scott Fitzgerald of Wisconsin told Fox, \"Everyone knows that chocolate chip cookies baked in a gas oven are better than those made in an electric oven. I\u2019m totally opposed, and this whole thing is ridiculous.\"\n\nDownplaying Trumka Jr.'s remarks in a statement Wednesday, Hoehn-Saric addressed the \"attention paid to gas stove emissions\" and the agency in recent days.\n\n\"Research indicates that emissions from gas stoves can be hazardous, and the CPSC is looking for ways to reduce related indoor air quality hazards. But to be clear, I am not looking to ban gas stoves and the CPSC has no proceeding to do so,\" Hoehn-Saric said.\n\n\"CPSC is researching gas emissions in stoves and exploring new ways to address any health risks,\" he added. \"CPSC also is actively engaged in strengthening voluntary safety standards for gas stoves.

Teamsters Local 174 to review a Washington State Supreme Court ruling that grants union officials immunity from state lawsuits over deliberate property damage perpetrated during union strike actions.\n\nWhile largely under the radar, the case could be a stealth blockbuster if the Justices use the opportunity to begin a more fundamental review of the myriad of double standards that shield unions and union officials from basic legal principles that apply to every other private organization and individual.\n\nIn the case, concrete company Glacier Northwest sued the Teamsters union for an estimated $100,000 in property damage orchestrated by union officials during a 2017 strike. The Washington Supreme Court later blocked the lawsuit and sided with union bosses, finding that federal labor law releases them from liability because the damage was \"inflicted through a strike as a legitimate bargaining tactic.\"\n\nAs flagrant as immunity from property damage lawsuits might seem, the exemption in Glacier is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to special union boss legal privileges.

The controversial 1973 US v. Enmons Supreme Court decision immunized union officials from the federal Hobbs Anti-Extortion Act when their extortionate violence is used \"to achieve legitimate union objectives.\"\n\nA high-profile example of the kind of behavior Enmons permits occurred in 2014, when Teamsters militants slashed the tires of Top Chef TV show vehicles and threatened host Padma Lakshmi that they would \"bash that pretty face in\" because union officials were angry members weren\u2019t given production jobs on the show. A judge instructed jurors in the resulting case that, per Enmons, conviction should turn on whether those jobs were legitimate union objectives. The result? Not guilty.\n\nViolence isn\u2019t the only thing union bosses get away with legally that others would not. The most fundamental power that unions wield \u2013 the ability to force unwilling workers under their monopoly \"representation\" \u2013 lacks any parallel outside of labor law. Even convicted criminals can choose their own legal representative, yet union officials can deny workers the same choice in employment matters.\n\nIn the 2018 Janus v.

In the 1944 Steele v. Louisville & Nashville Railroad case, the Supreme Court seemingly came close to striking down monopoly bargaining in the private sector. In that case, white railway union officials were using their bargaining powers to engage in blatant racial discrimination against black workers.\n\nThe Steele decision noted that organized labor has been granted \"powers comparable to those of a legislative body both to create and restrict the rights of those it represents.\" Yet instead of striking down the federal law authorizing such powers and the resulting discrimination, the court attempted a compromise by conjuring an ambiguous \"duty of fair representation\" standard into the law.

Despite wall-to-wall coverage of the speaker election, most media outlets ignored that conservatives are unified behind the desire to fix the top issue facing our country, the national debt and President Biden\u2019s reckless spending agenda.\n\nRestoring fiscal sanity will be what unites the House\u2019s Republican majority and advances the conservative movement in 2023. The Republican Study Committee (RSC), reinforced by new House Rules designed to rein in excessive spending, will be leading that charge.\n\nNancy Pelosi\u2019s $2 trillion lame duck omnibus, which was riddled with additional mandatory spending, only added to our nation\u2019s $31 trillion national debt and accelerated the United States\u2019 approach to yet another fiscal cliff: the debt limit, which is set to expire later in 2023.\n\nSince Biden took office, Democrats have created $10 trillion in new spending, a record amount in just two years. Overspending has left America\u2019s fiscal house in ruin and our economy ravaged with record inflation. Many economists believe next year brings new risks of major recession, stagflation and market instability.\n\nHOUSE REPUBLICANS TO VOTE ON BILL ABOLISHING IRS, ELIMINATING INCOME TAX\n\nRather than take any responsibility, Biden and his allies have tried repeatedly to blame Republicans and the so-called \"Trump tax cuts\" for America\u2019s yearly deficits. This assertion is simply false. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office now projects that revenues are on track to increase by roughly $500 billion over 10 years since TCJA\u2019s enactment \u2013 even after adjusting for inflation. Furthermore, 2022 tax revenues were the second highest in history outside of World War II.\n\nThis much we know is true: our government does not have a revenue problem, it has a spending problem.\n\nAt some point, the government will run out of borrowing authority in 2023. As we approach this harsh reality, it\u2019s our responsibility in Congress to institute real spending reforms and restraints. It\u2019s been over a decade since Congress enacted meaningful legislation to fight our swelling debt, and in that period, about $16 trillion has been added to our national debt. It more than doubled.\n\nConservatives must be bold. We must fight to restore fiscal sanity and rein in government spending. Major reforms to the budget and appropriations process are necessary, as well as significant reductions in spending. Our voters elected us to ease the economic pain; anything else is a disservice to them.\n\nI recently began my tenure as the new chairman of the RSC. My job is to ensure our members are given the policy knowledge and a voice to advance their conservative priorities.\n\nRegarding our spending problem, there\u2019s a lot we can and must do to tackle it. For starters, lawmakers should institute strong discretionary statutory caps on spending, rather than leaving our annual limits up to negotiations conducted by a handful of powerful members. More mandatory spending should be subject to the annual appropriations process, reversing the persistent trend of moving discretionary spending to the mandatory side of the ledger. Congress must not shy away from reforms needed to protecting the solvency of our most important safety net entitlement programs.\n\nMoreover, countless government programs are non-essential or duplicative and must be consolidated or eliminated. In 2010, Congress required the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to inventory all existing government programs on their website. Over 12 years later, OMB is still unable to count how many federal programs exist. This is unacceptable.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nI am pleased that one of the promises made by House Republican leadership during last week\u2019s negotiations was to pursue through regular order a congressional budget that balances in 10 years.

The longer we wait to begin the work of balancing the budget, the harder that process will become.\n\nIt\u2019s time for conservatives to fight \u2013 relentlessly \u2013 to reduce government spending.

State-approved shops in Montville, New Haven, Branford, Newington, Stamford, Willimantic and Meriden were expected to open their doors to the general public on the first day. Two other approved dispensaries, in Danbury and Torrington, will open at a later date.\n\nIt's unclear whether the novelty of legalized marijuana has worn off a bit for Connecticut consumers, considering retail sales began in 2018 in neighboring Massachusetts and last month in neighboring Rhode Island and New York.\n\nHOW WOKENESS TURNED NEW YORK INTO WEED CITY\n\nTwenty-one states have legalized recreational marijuana for adults over the past decade, even though it remains illegal under federal law. After voters approved legalization in Maryland and Missouri in November, marijuana advocates are now pressing forward with similar efforts elsewhere in the U.S., including in Oklahoma and Ohio.\n\nAs of Feb. 3, 2022, 37 states, three territories and the District of Columbia allow the medical use of cannabis products, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nConnecticut's \"hybrid\" medical and recreational cannabis retail shops were still planning for large crowds Tuesday. At The Botanist in Montville, extra staff will be in place and a shuttle service will bring customers from satellite parking lots.\n\nKate Nelson, senior vice president of the Midwest and Northwest regions for Acreage Holdings, which owns The Botanist brand, said about 200-300 medical marijuana purchases are made on average at the Montville location. She's predicting there will be a 150% uptick in sales during the first week of adult-use recreational business, but acknowledged that will likely level off.\n\nThe company's second location in Connecticut, located in Danbury, is expected to open in the next few weeks after local approvals are finalized.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I think even before the 40 operators come online, you\u2019ll start to see less of that excitement of something new and more so of kind of what the status quo will become,\" she said. \"We\u2019re in an area now in the country where there\u2019s other adult-use states nearby. So it\u2019s really going to be a focus of ours, in the state of Connecticut specifically, to make sure that this adult-use program has the product that it needs to have and we can support the industry ... to make sure Connecticut sets themselves apart from other competing markets.\"\n\nInitial sales in Connecticut will be limited to one-quarter of an ounce of cannabis flower or its equivalent, in an effort to ensure there will be enough support for medical marijuana patients. Different items can be purchased together to make up the one-quarter ounce. The state's Department of Consumer Protection plans to watch retail sales and manufacturing supplies closely to determine when that amount can eventually be increased."}, {"title": "Sale of recreational marijuana in Maine increases by nearly double in 2022", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/sale-recreational-marijuana-maine-increases-nearly-double-2022", "tag": "MAINE", "content": "The sale of recreational cannabis products increased by nearly double in Maine in 2022.\n\nAlmost $159 million in cannabis products were sold in the state last year, according to the Office of Cannabis Policy.

She was glad her local public school had a good reputation for quality. But even though her son made honor roll consistently, Kat suspected something was wrong. She never saw him writing, and she felt he wasn\u2019t getting the help he needed at school for his ADHD.\n\nWhen her son\u2019s school closed during the COVID-19 pandemic, she learned just how bad things were. Assessments showed that her \"honor roll student\" was three years below grade level in math and could barely write more than a few sentences.\n\nFortunately, Kat\u2019s family lives in Arizona, where they had access to Empowerment Scholarship Accounts. Kat calls them \"a godsend.\" With an ESA, families can access state funds to pay for private school tuition, tutoring, textbooks, online courses, special needs therapy, and numerous other educational expenses.\n\nIn 2011, Arizona became the first state to adopt an ESA policy. Just over a decade later, nine states have ESAs and several others \u2013 including Idaho, Iowa, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Texas \u2013 may soon follow suit.\n\nWE'RE NOT THE FLORIDA THEY PUT ON POSTCARDS, BUT SCHOOL CHOICE WORKS FOR US TOO\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to understand why. During the pandemic, lots of families got a rude awakening about the quality of their children\u2019s education. That sent them searching for alternatives to their assigned schools. In a recent Morning Consult poll, two-thirds of Americans and 74% of parents of school-aged children said they support ESA policies that empower families with greater education choice.\n\nBut not everyone is on board. The teachers\u2019 unions and their allies are doing everything in their power to block families from accessing alternatives to the district school system.\n\nOne tactic they\u2019re employing is to claim that school choice policies either don\u2019t benefit rural areas or are harmful to rural district schools. The Texas Association of School Boards claims that for rural families, \"options other than their local public schools are few and far between.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Oklahoma\u2019s former Superintendent of Public Instruction Joy Hoffmeister claimed that school choice would spur so many students to leave rural district schools that the policy amounted to a \"rural school killer.\"\n\nEDUCATION CHOICE SUPPORTERS WIN BIG IN 2022 MIDTERM ELECTIONS\n\nThese two claims \u2013 that there are no options in rural areas and that rural schools are imperiled because so many students will leave for those options \u2013 are mutually exclusive. They cannot both be true simultaneously, but they can both be \u2013 and indeed are \u2013 false.\n\nFirst, as we detail in a new Heritage Foundation report, families in rural areas have access to more education options than ever before.\n\nAbout seven in 10 rural families live within 10 miles of a private elementary school. While charter schools are scarcer in rural areas, they\u2019re accessible in states that have encouraged their formation and growth. In Arizona, more than eight in 10 students live in the same zip code as at least one charter school.\n\nRural areas are also seeing the rise of micro-schools, a modern reimagining of the one-room schoolhouse. Groups like Acton Academy, Adamo Education, Great Hearts, Kai Pods and Prenda are teaching students in small groups, sometimes operating out of homes or church basements. Their approaches vary greatly \u2013 ranging from classical to Montessori \u2013 but all offer greater flexibility and individualized attention than the traditional classroom environment.\n\nAdditionally, high-quality virtual schools are available to anyone with a decent Internet connection \u2013 which is becoming increasingly available in rural America. A 2021 survey by the Pew Research Center found that 72% rural Americans said they have a broadband Internet connection at home, up 19 percentage points since 2016.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nKat lives in a rural area of Arizona and her son uses his ESA to learn online via Outschool. In addition to core classes like English, math and science, he takes several electives. One of his favorites was an \"adulting\" class where he learned how to manage a bank account, keep a check book, read receipts, and more. And, yes, he\u2019s now reading and writing essays on grade level.\n\nAs for fears that the wide availability of education options would \"kill\" rural schools, that hasn\u2019t happened. Arizona, for example, has consistently ranked among the top states for education freedom and choice over the past two decades. More students exercise their school choice options in Arizona than in any other state. If choice policies harmed district schools, then Arizona\u2019s rural schools would be falling apart.\n\nIn fact, Arizona\u2019s rural schools are improving much more than the national average. From 2007 to 2019, Arizona rural students\u2019 fourth and eighth grade reading and math scores on the National Assessment for Educational Progress increased by a combined 21 points, while scores in rural schools nationally decreased by two points. On the most recent NAEP, post-pandemic, Arizona\u2019s rural students were still up a combined nine points while rural students nationally dropped 17 points from 2007.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFar from being a \"rural school killer,\" education choice policies like ESAs expand educational opportunity for rural families while spurring rural district schools to improve their performance.\n\nBy embracing education choice policies, state lawmakers can deliver on the promise of America\u2019s education system and ensure that all children have access to the learning environment that best meets their individual needs and helps them to achieve their full potential.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY JASON BEDRICK\n\nMatthew Ladner, Ph.D., is director of the Arizona Center for Student Opportunity at the Arizona Charter School Association."}, {"title": "Gaetz and Rogers weren\u2019t the first: Here are the wildest times lawmakers have come to blows inside the Capitol", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gaetz-rogers-werent-first-wildest-times-lawmakers-come-blows-capitol", "tag": "CONGRESS", "content": "Rep.

Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., but it would've been far from the first time a disagreement among lawmakers came to blows in the Capitol.\n\nBoth the House of Representatives and the Senate have a checkered history of lawmakers attacking one another over various disagreements, with the fights ranging from a single punch or a beating with a cane to the drawing of firearms on the floor.\n\nOne of the first widely recorded incidents came in 1798 between Roger Griswold and Matthew Lyon, a pair of lawmakers from Connecticut and Vermont, respectively. Griswold called Lyon a \"scoundrel\" during a disagreement, considered an aggressive curse at the time. Lyon responded by spitting in Griswold's face, and the two then went at it until their colleagues separated them.\n\nThe pair weren't done, however, as Griswold again attacked Lyon a few weeks later, this time using a cane. Lyons defended himself using a pair of fire tongs, according to the Congressional Record.\n\nTHE VOTE FOR HOUSE SPEAKER\n\nUnsurprisingly, many fights between lawmakers centered on debates over slavery just prior to the Civil War. In 1850, Thomas Benton of Missouri, a Democrat who opposed slavery, drew a pistol and pointed it at his colleague, Henry Foote of Mississippi, during a long disagreement about the topic. Benton's colleagues were able to talk him down before he fired, however.\n\nKEVIN MCCARTHY ELECTED HOUSE SPEAKER IN 15TH FLOOR VOTE AFTER DAYS OF HIGH DRAMA\n\nSoon after in 1856, Congressman Preston Brooks of South Carolina, who was pro-slavery, severely beat a fellow lawmaker with a cane shortly after he had made a floor speech in the Senate. The victim, Sen. Charles Sumner of Massachusetts, had criticized a family member of Brooks' and derided slaveholders as \"pimps.\"\n\nWhile lawmakers attempted to intervene in the beating, Brooks' fellow South Carolina congressman, Sen. Laurence Keitt, drew a pistol and threatened anyone who attempted to intervene. Sumner was left unconscious and took years to recover.\n\nBrooks' attack preceded another that would come nearly 50 years later in 1902, this time a disagreement between senators of the same state. John McLaurin, South Carolina's junior senator, raced into the chamber on Feb. 22 and condemned the senior senator, Ben Tillman, for spreading \"a willful, malicious, and deliberate lie.\"\n\n\"Standing nearby, Tillman spun around and punched McLaurin squarely in the jaw,\" the Congressional Record states. \"The chamber exploded in pandemonium as members struggled to separate both members of the South Carolina delegation. In a long moment, it was over, but not without stinging bruises both to bystanders and to the Senate's sense of decorum.\"\n\nJORDAN DEFENDS SPEAKER VOTE, SAYS THIS IS HOW DEMOCRACY IS SUPPOSED TO BE\n\nThe largest fight that ever broke out among lawmakers occurred in 1858 and was once again about slavery. Lawmakers were debating the Kansas Territory's pro-slavery constitution late into the night on Feb. 5, according to House records.\n\nThe first sparks flew in the early morning hours of Feb. 6, as Pennsylvania Republican Galusha Grow and South Carolina Democrat Laurence Keitt \u2013 a returning figure\u2013 threw insults at one another. The pair soon started throwing punches, and reports from the time say the House floor ignited into conflict as Northern Republicans fought with Southern Democrats, with 30-some lawmakers joining the frenzy.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSoon, the sergeant-at-arms waded into the fray and restored order, but not before a pair of Republicans ripped the wig off the head of Mississippi Democrat William Barksdale, according to the chamber's records.

A hot job market was the proximate cause, but the crisis has been years in the making. It reflects a confluence of obesity, lack of high school diplomas and accelerated mental health crises among youth. So, too, while the all-volunteer force (AVF) has been a great success on many counts, it has separated the military from wider society, leaving declining interest in military service and the Army recruiting from a smaller and smaller pool of military families.\n\nThere are changes that the Army can make to address the negative long-term trends. Here are suggestions across six dimensions:\n\n1. Message better\n\nThis is trite and easy to say but hard to do. Still, Gen Zers are likely to be more attracted to the Army if they knew what it really did. No doubt jumping out of airplanes would seem way cool on Instagram. No FOMO (fear of missing out) there. The Army provides a demanding, extreme career, and it has a compelling story to tell, offering not only skills training with significant value in the civilian marketplace but also a wide range of experiences. Those include: independence but with protection; military housing lets soldiers get married and live on their own without having to pay a fortune for a home.\n\nBIDEN ADMIN LIFTS MILITARY VACCINE MANDATE WITH DEFENSE ACT\n\n2. Target more carefully\n\nGen Z is diverse, and the risk is treating would-be recruits as single-minded when in fact motivations vary widely. Some are interested in developing specific career skills, while others may want a path to citizenship, general employment, or look to mature. Some will be moved by sincere patriotism and a desire to make an impact.\n\n3. Start early\n\nWith less brand awareness, the Army would be well served to get in the hearts and minds of those before they are able to join the service. Programs such as the junior lifeguard program offered by LA County Fire could be a great model to make the Army brand strong among potential recruits. Starting early is also a way to dispel misperceptions about what the standards are, then provide support to would-be recruits in getting fitter, passing the GED or preparing for the Armed Forces Qualification Test.\n\n4. Help candidates meet standards that make sense\n\nThe Army is understandably loath to relax standards because the economy is hot, or to have looser standards for the Reserves. Yet some of the issues are no-brainers: age limits were relaxed during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. For both the active force and the Reserves, there is no reason the specialist who will never be in harm\u2019s way must be as fit as the infantry soldier, just like infantry paratroopers don\u2019t need deep cyber skills.\n\n5. Rethink commitments\n\nSilicon Valley salaries will make it very hard to recruit techies for the usual commitment, and so it is time to contemplate more flexibility: might patriotism and an interest in being active in another realm \u2013 experienced by most only in movies \u2013 tempt those techies and other sought-after specialists if the commitment were only a year, with companies committed to their return? More generally, the challenge in recruiting those Gen Zers is finding ways to plug into them rather than making them plug into you.\n\n6. Recognize it\u2019s about the mission and people\n\nManagement guru Peter Drucker\u2019s motto was: \"The best investment you will ever make are your employees.\" While the Air Force and Navy are platform centric, the Army, like the Marines, is people-centric, all about the individual warfighter. Assigning the best and brightest to the recruiting mission will serve not only the soldier but the Army itself.\n\nThe deep traditions and ingrained culture of the Army are a source of pride and institutional power but can also make the Army incredibly resistant to change \u2013 even for the better. Yet the culture is also \"can do\": from women in combat to \"don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell,\" to open acceptance of gays, what was feared to risk institutional collapse turned out to be non-events that broadened the pool of talent. Now, Army \"can do\" compels it to innovate its recruiting processes and better connect the Army\u2019s needs and opportunities to the strengths and aspirations of Gen Z.\n\nGregory F.

The $2 trillion Omnibus Spending bill.\n\nEven with the nation\u2019s finances in shambles and even with Republicans promising that they would get control of Uncle Sam\u2019s record red ink, Biden joined hands with Republicans to pass yet another gargantuan year-end spending bill filled with pork, and beefy increases for nearly every federal agency. Both parties share the blame for this oinker. If there were ever an argument for term limits, this was it.\n\nShame, shame, shame \u2013 especially on Republicans who claim to be against big government but vote for it.\n\n2. California passes a law requiring all new cars to be electric vehicles by 2035\n\nPolls show by wide margins Americans don\u2019t want to be forced to buy electric cars and only 6% of all new car sales are EVs. But California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom and the Sacramento politicians weren\u2019t listening.

Many states paid families more than $75,000 in annualized welfare benefits in 2022\n\nWhy are there still three to four million fewer Americans working than before COVID even with millions of job openings?\n\nOne reason is that in more than 20 states a family of four can get benefits that exceed the pay of a construction worker, a mechanic, a security guard or a factory worker.

Most significantly, Elon Musk\u2019s takeover of Twitter has driven many users to niche, specialized alternatives. The genie is out of the Big Tech bottle.\n\nSome say that Big Tech should never have been allowed to get so big. That\u2019s understandable: At more than $1.4 trillion, the five big tech companies in the US have more revenue than the GDP of either Mexico or Spain.\n\nBut the real problem isn\u2019t its size, or even its power.

Some may even be angry that, since those firms bought out so many newer competitors - and prevented new competitors from emerging by controlling so much talent - there are limited opportunities elsewhere.\n\n\n\nA small number of the laid off will become the entrepreneurial fuel for the next wave of innovation in tech, something that we need.\n\nAccording to Dorothy Neufeld, over the last 250 years, we have witnessed multiple waves of innovation that ranged from the Industrial Revolution to green tech. We are currently in the sixth wave and the shortest of them all - AI.\n\nWe need as much competition as possible to maximize this wave. We need as much talent out there solving as many problems as possible. We can\u2019t have Big Tech, who for many years now has broken its promise to \u2018move fast and break things\u2019, holding us back.

They are already being broken up by creative destruction of the markets.\n\n\n\nThe next Steve Jobs or Bill Gates is likely sitting at a desk right now getting paid a mid six-figure salary just so they won\u2019t leave and become a competitor to their current employer. I hope - for the sake of that person, and our economy - they are included in the current wave of layoffs.\n\nApple and Microsoft - the grandfathers of Big Tech - became so successful and changed the entire world because of competition.

For years, I\u2019d contemplated the mysteriously thin line that marked the distinct trajectories of our lives and, in our heartfelt conversations, I would learn that my brother had been homeless for many years during our time apart.\n\nHow had he survived years of hitching rides, jumping trains, sleeping under overpasses, and, as he later told me, more than once, running for his life? How did he view our time growing up together? Why had our lives gone in such different directions? Was it genetic? Simple human desire? Had fickle fate intervened?

While these measures are certainly worth pursuing, there\u2019s a roadblock: permitting reform.\n\nIn layman\u2019s terms, permitting reform refers to the process by which construction and development projects receive government approval and necessary permits. The current permitting process for new energy projects is slow, cumbersome, and often ineffective.

The energy shortage is largely due to an over reliance on solar and wind generated power made worse by Europe\u2019s 2015 Paris Climate Accord agreement, which mandated the closing of coal-fired power plants and replacing them with less reliable wind and solar power alternatives.\n\nThere is no doubt that unpredictable energy sources such as these cause unnecessary suffering, financial strain and even illness among the most vulnerable. Americans should take heed from Europe\u2019s misguided energy strategy and misplaced reliance on wind and solar power, or else watch many regions of the United States endure lengthy power shortages.\n\nAs the colder months roll in, Europe could soon face temporary cuts in cell phone and internet service, school closures from a lack of lighting and heating and even traffic jams from underpowered traffic lights.

The truth is that alternative energy sources proposed by Europe are far from a smart investment for families suffering from low energy production.\n\nWhen it comes to relying on wind power, sometimes the wind just doesn\u2019t blow. Europe experienced this phenomenon in 2021 when a drastic reduction in wind caused a decrease in energy generation by wind turbines. Just recently, wind power production in the UK fell from 28% of overall energy production to just 3%.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nDue to a lack of wind power, the UK\u2019s reliance on coal for energy outperformed wind and solar even though the country has nearly banned its coal production entirely. The reliability of coal is so obvious that the nation is beginning to reinvest in coal mines to keep the plants open for business. Still, it\u2019s doubtful such reinvestment will spur an uptick in reliable energy in time to protect its citizens from frigid winter temperatures.\n\nSolar energy, on the other hand, has proven to be just as unpredictable in its output, despite Europe\u2019s aggressive commitment to the source. Since Russia cut gas supplies after Europe\u2019s sanctions over the war in Ukraine, there has been a sharp increase in demand for natural gas, forcing prices to rise higher and higher as a result. But this is a bad omen for elderly, lower-income Europeans ill-equipped to deal with the consequences of supply chain issues.\n\nOrdinarily, Europe sees an increase in winter deaths but over 100,000 Europeans could die from high energy prices this winter, according to a study by The Economist magazine. If each country experiences its coldest winter since 2000, the death toll could rise to 185,000.

When you only serve one side\u2014there\u2019s a disruptive model coming,\" he told Fox News Digital.\n\nStutts, who has contributed to over 1,545 election victories, including three presidential victories through political marketing, said the business of politics holds many parallels to the media industry. He compared several high-profile news organizations to political campaigns that fizzle out in general elections when they continue to only cater to their base\u2014serving only the most hardcore subscribers.\n\n\"They\u2019ve grossly underestimated what the market is.

Discovery\u2019s CNN laid off hundreds of employees earlier this month, from high-profile talent to rank-and-file staffers. The Washington Post has announced it will cut jobs in the first quarter of 2023. Newspaper juggernaut Gannett recently cut roughly 6% of its news workforces, and NPR has enacted a near-total hiring freeze, ending its summer internship program in the process.\n\nStutts specifically pointed to The Post ending production of its Sunday paper as an example of how people are picking and choosing the content, creators, editorial writers, and topics that they want\u2014rather than subjecting themselves to an inundation of content they do not find interesting.\n\n\"People don\u2019t want mass news. They want to get the news from the people that they believe, and trust, and they don\u2019t want any more fluff. And that\u2019s the model,\" he said.\n\nThrough his experiencing founding corporate marketing agency Win BIG Media and political marketing firm Go BIG Media, Stutts asserted that waning media companies are suffering because they advocate for policies that half of their customers do not agree with, during an economic period when people need to make smart decisions with their money. Such a lack of alignment with customer needs is a common \"fundamental flaw\" among many ailing institutions, including higher education and the tech industry.\n\nBoth higher-education and the tech field are facing financial hardships like the media and entertainment industry.\n\nCNN BEGINS LAYOFFS UNDER CHRIS LICHT: 'DIFFICULT TIME FOR EVERYONE'\n\nCompared to two years ago, the number of undergraduates enrolled in college nationwide is down 9.4%, according to CNBC. Numerous schools are in financial jeopardy, with some having to close entirely. The number of colleges forced to close in the past 10 years has quadrupled since the previous decade.\n\nMeanwhile, the tech industry, which just a few years ago was rigorously pursued by college graduates for its vast array of available and well-paying jobs, has seen mass hiring freezes and layoffs in the past year. Nearly 1,000 tech companies have laid off more than 150,000 tech workers since the start of 2022.\n\n\"They\u2019re just arrogantly running out there and letting their employees dictate what their customers want. That\u2019s a huge problem. That\u2019s why these companies are falling all over themselves,\" Stutts said. \"This is suicide. It\u2019s business suicide.\"\n\nHe predicted that startups like Bari Weiss' The Free Press, and independent journalists like her and Matt Taibbi, will continue to see growth because they court readers on the left, right and center. But these smaller-scale operations could grow into emerging media empires, thus continuing the cycle of media mega-corporations.

Sean Patrick Maloney, D-N.Y.\n\nThe move from Jeffries will have to be ratified by the full Democratic Caucus, but placing the selection itself in the party leader's hands is a new development.

Or, perhaps, when they are forced to retain the staff of a previous regime that should be replaced for the very ineffectiveness that led to the turnover in leadership? Or when, in the run-up to Election Day, union bosses make sweeping demands backed up by a threat to strike?\"\n\nMix insisted the decisions made by each committee to unionize were part of an \"effort to display their forced unionism bona fides and to cozy up to the Big Labor officials who fund their campaigns.\"\n\n\"Union affiliation should be the voluntary decision of every worker, not forced on them against their will by union officials or by an employer as part its virtue signaling and fundraising,\" he said. \"That said, the campaigns these committees support nearly uniformly seek to foist a union on every business and worker in America, like it or not, and use the power of the federal government to do it. So in their dealings with their own union, I can only offer them the best of luck.\"\n\nDCCC CHAIR CHOICE PUTS HOUSE DEMOCRATS' NEW LEADER IN THE HOT SEAT\n\nSimilarly, Josh Kraushaar, a senior political correspondent for Axios and a Fox News contributor, said the unionization of the committees could put Democrats at a \"competitive disadvantage\" against Republicans ahead of the 2024 presidential elections.\n\n\"Campaign work typically requires long hours for low pay \u2014 with most jobs demanding maximum flexibility at a moment's notice,\" Kraushaar told Fox News Digital. \"It's not the type of work that's conducive to bureaucratic requirements and regulations. Democrats run the risk that by unionizing campaign work, they will be at a competitive disadvantage against their rivals.\"\n\n\"Even Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign initially resisted paying its staff a $15 minimum wage, as the senator called on all businesses to do,\" he added.\n\nDespite concern from others who believe the vote to unionize could pose a threat to Democrats going forward under new leadership, a spokesperson for the DCCC, who noted the committee must follow certain notice and severance obligations, said its union contract allows for staffing adjustments between cycles that are based on business needs and to focus on strategic priorities.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn August, the DCCC Staff Union \u2014 which is represented by Teamsters Local 238 \u2014 announced the ratification of its first collective bargaining agreement, which included \"extending 100% employer-paid health insurance to staff,\" as well as \"raising wages to reflect the value of DCCC employees\" and \"rewarding employees who bring valuable language expertise to the committee.\"\n\n\"DCCC is proud to have a strong union that protects workers \u2014 it\u2019s a core Democratic value,\" said DCCC spokesperson Chris Taylor.\n\n\"Together with our union partners, we developed a contract that recognizes the nature of our organization and best positions us to capture a Democratic House majority.\""}, {"title": "Democrats release report on Trump tax returns, revealing income, taxes paid, IRS audit", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-release-report-on-trump-tax-returns-revealing-income-taxes-paid-irs-audit", "tag": "DONALD TRUMP", "content": "A report on former President Donald Trump's tax returns was published Tuesday as part of an ongoing investigation by the House Committee on Ways and Means.\n\nDemocrats with the committee released their findings Tuesday in a document titled, \"Report on the Internal Revenue Service's Mandatory Audit Program Under the Prior Administration (2017-2020).\"\n\nREP.

They don\u2019t have to work for the stuff on their Christmas lists; he just gives it to them.\n\nIn many states, gratuitous welfare benefits have made that childhood fantasy an adult reality. Professor Casey Mulligan of the University of Chicago and I have found that some families can receive the annualized equivalent of a six-figure income with no one working \u2013 and you\u2019re paying for it.\n\nDuring the pandemic, idled workers received unemployment \"bonuses\" so high that many were pocketing more than twice what they had been making on the job. Even without these extra weekly payments, unemployment benefits can reach unexpected high levels in many states. In New Jersey, for instance, a family of four with no one working can receive unemployment benefits equivalent to a job paying over $96,000. That\u2019s more than the median household earns in wages and benefits combined.\n\nHigh unemployment benefits are not unique to the Garden State. In 13 states, a family can receive annualized unemployment benefits worth more than the median household income. The value of unemployment benefits comes not just from their sheer size, but their tax advantages as well. Unlike earned income, unemployment benefits are exempt from payroll taxes, and six states also exempt them from the respective state income tax.\n\nUNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS AND OBAMACARE SUBSIDIES OUTPACE MEDIAN INCOME IN SEVERAL STATES, STUDY FINDS\n\nAnd while the pandemic-related unemployment benefits have ended, the Affordable Care Act (\"Obamacare\") subsidies have just kept expanding. A program that was sold to the American people as a hand up for the poor has quickly been transformed into a handout for upper income earners.\n\nIn some parts of the country, a family of four earning over half a million dollars still qualifies for Obamacare subsidies. Those with a quarter million-dollar income qualify in nearly the entire country.\n\nThe annualized value of these healthcare subsidies and unemployment benefits for a family of four can exceed a six-figure income. In Washington state, the amount is more than $122,000, substantially more than many blue-collar incomes.\n\nIn fact, it is 32 percent more than the wages and benefits of the median household; 51 percent more than the median secondary school teacher\u2019s wages and benefits; 95 percent more the median machinist\u2019s salary and benefits, and 220 percent more than the median retail associate\u2019s salary and benefits.\n\nBut Washington state is not alone. In 29 states, unemployment benefits and Obamacare subsidies are worth more than the wages and benefits earned by the median firefighter or truckdriver. In 14 states, these two programs pay annualized benefits exceeding the wages and benefits of the median electrician.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nWhile our study examined only two welfare programs that are not means-tested, there is an entire suite of means-tested programs for which many people are eligible, and which together provide a surprisingly high standard of living.\n\nIn Loudoun County, Virginia, just outside Washington, D.C., you can receive over $25,000 in annual rental assistance alone \u2013 and that is just one program.

During a signing ceremony, Blinken said the \"future\" was happening, given the importance of cobalt for manufacturing electric vehicles.\n\n\"I really want to commend the DRC and Zambia, their governments for their leadership and vision in developing an electric vehicle battery council,\" Blinken said Tuesday. \"This is the future, and it is happening in the DRC and in Zambia.\"\n\nDRC foreign minister Stanley Kakubo added during the event that his country was committed to actualizing the deal \"in a hurry.\"\n\nGREEN ENERGY PROJECTS FACE STARK ENVIRONMENTAL, LOCAL OPPOSITION NATIONWIDE\n\nGreen energy technologies like electric vehicle batteries, solar panels and wind turbines require a massive expansion of cobalt, copper, lithium, nickel, graphite, zinc and other mineral production. The vast majority of mining and processing of such materials, though, takes place outside the U.S., making the nation more reliant on foreign minerals despite its large domestic resources.\n\nIn 2021, the DRC alone mined more than 70% of the global supply of cobalt, while the U.S. mined just 0.4%, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The DRC also has an estimated 3.5 million metric tons of cobalt reserves, the largest amount in the world.\n\nENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS KEEP PUSHING EXTREME MEASURES AMID GLOBAL ENERGY CRISIS\n\nHowever, independent investigations conducted in recent years by the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) and Amnesty International have documented how many cobalt mines located in the DRC employ child laborers. The Biden administration also released a report in October showing that child labor continues to take place in the mines.\n\n\"Many children we spoke to told us that they were frequently ill. Inhaling cobalt dust can cause hard metal lung disease \u2014 a potentially fatal condition,\" a 2016 Amnesty International report stated. \"Skin contact with cobalt can cause dermatitis \u2014 a chronic rash. Yet the children and other miners have neither masks nor gloves to protect them.\"\n\n\"The children told us that they endured long hours \u2014 up to 12 hours a day \u2014 working at the mines hauling back-breaking loads of between 20 and 40kg for US$1-2 per day,\" it continued. \"Many had nothing to eat all day. Fourteen-year-old Paul, who began mining aged 12 and worked underground, told us he would often \u2018spend 24 hours down in the tunnels. I arrived in the morning and would leave the following morning.\u2019\"\n\nOverall, about 40,000 children are believed to work in mines in southern DRC, according to UNICEF.\n\n\"It's egregious that the Biden administration would enter into an MOU to mine critical minerals in the Congo, where we know they use child slave labor to mine these minerals and they have almost zero labor standards and almost zero environmental standards,\" Rep.

We want to know why they've pulled federal permits without allowing an environmental impact statement to move forward.\"\n\nEarlier this year, the Department of the Interior canceled two existing hardrock mineral leases in the mineral-rich Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness in northern Minnesota and announced that it would move forward with a 20-year ban on new mining projects in the region, citing environmental reasons.\n\nThe projects contained about 88% of the nation's cobalt reserves and had a project labor agreement in place for the site to be unionized.\n\nBIDEN ANNOUNCES $36 BILLION BAILOUT FOR UNION PENSION PLAN\n\n\"Don't just listen to Joe Biden and his activist administration's words, look at their actions,\" said Stauber, who represents the district where the projects are located. \"Joe Biden, as far as workers go and mining goes, is 'anywhere but America and any worker but American.' It's unacceptable.\"\n\nIn addition, the Biden administration has implemented regulatory roadblocks on mines in Alaska, Arizona and Nevada, which have massive copper, molybdenum and lithium deposits.\n\nThe National Mining Association (NMA), meanwhile, said it wasn't surprised at the administration's action given the immediate need for resources, but argued there was significant need for a better long-term strategy.\n\n\"It would be a mistake to interpret a strategy intent on ensuring immediate supply as a long-term comprehensive strategy that will effectively meet demands for the future,\" NMA spokesperson Ashley Burke told Fox News Digital. \"There needs to be a much greater focus on mine permitting at home.\"\n\n\"We have robust mineral reserves here in the U.S.; there is simply no better place for the administration to be supporting mining projects, supporting our economy with high-paying American jobs that are producing American materials under world-leading environmental, labor and safety standards,\" Burke continued.\n\nThe NMA has repeatedly sounded the alarm on U.S. mineral supply chains as the federal government pushes green transition policies. In August, the group said relying on mineral imports has been an \"increasingly problematic issue for decades and has now become a crisis.\" The group has also advocated for a streamlined permitting process for mining projects.\n\n\"The MOU aligns with the Minerals Security Partnership\u2019s objectives to ensure critical minerals in the DRC and Zambia are produced, processed, and recycled in a manner that supports countries in realizing the full economic development potential of their mineral resources,\" a State Department spokesperson told Fox News Digital in a statement.\n\n\"Moreover, U.S. assistance will help catalyze investment for strategic opportunities \u2014across the full electric vehicle value chain \u2014that adhere to the highest environmental, social, and governance standards.\"\n\nThe spokesperson said the federal government would \"continue to engage the government of the DRC through bilateral diplomacy and foreign assistance to increase efforts to combat human trafficking, including child forced labor.\""}, {"title": "Michigan Democrats want to steal my rights so they can reward their union buddies", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/michigan-democrats-want-steal-my-rights-they-reward-their-union-buddies", "tag": "OPINION", "content": "NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n\nI will always remember the day I gained real freedom in the workplace. September 15, 2015.\n\nThat\u2019s the day my contract expired at Ford\u2019s Rawsonville plant in Ypsilanti, Michigan. The day I was finally able to resign from the United Auto Workers without being fired. The day I got to choose, for the first time, whether union membership was right for me. It\u2019s a choice I\u2019d wanted for nearly 20 years.\n\nEver since, I\u2019ve worked at the same plant, doing the same job, yet I\u2019ve kept more of my paycheck, and my conscience is clear. For seven-plus years, I haven\u2019t been forced to pay dues to the UAW, which lobbies for politicians and policies I don\u2019t support.\n\nGOP PLOTS SWING STATE SHAKE-UP TO PREVENT 2024 DEFEATS\n\nBut now my freedom may be revoked. Michigan Democrats, fresh off a victory in the midterm elections, seem determined to force workers like me to pay union dues \u2013 regardless of what we want. I can\u2019t imagine a bigger step backward for our state, or a bigger blow to my fundamental rights.\n\nI started working at the Rawsonville plant in 1996, following in the footsteps of my father, who took a job at Ford in the 1950s, and many uncles, aunts, and cousins over the years. None of us \u2013 not one \u2013 got to vote for the union. Yet none of us \u2013 not one \u2013 could leave the union without losing our job. Paying union dues was the price of working there. It was a price hardly any of us wanted to pay.\n\nThen, in 2012, Michigan flipped the script. The state passed a right-to-work law, giving every union member the freedom to opt out of union membership and stop paying dues. From that moment onward, as soon as a unionized worker\u2019s contract expired, they could exercise this freedom, like I did in 2015. And I\u2019m far from the only one.\n\nIn the United Auto Workers alone, membership has dropped more than 7% in the past decade. Other unions have seen even steeper declines, with the Teamsters losing almost a third of their members, and the SEIU losing nearly two-thirds. All told, across Michigan, private-sector union membership is down by more than 60,000 people, or nearly 20%. Clearly, a whole lot of folks didn\u2019t want to buy what the unions were selling.\n\nThat was certainly the case for me. As a lifelong conservative, I resented going to union meetings where I was told in no uncertain terms to vote for Democrats. I was tired of being screamed at \u2013 on the line, no less \u2013 by my plant\u2019s union chairman when I didn\u2019t toe the party line. I despised the climate of fear and conformity that led, and still leads, so many of my fellow line workers to stay silent.\n\nBut now my freedom may be revoked. Michigan Democrats, fresh off a victory in the midterm elections, seem determined to force workers like me to pay union dues \u2013 regardless of what we want. I can\u2019t imagine a bigger step backward for our state, or a bigger blow to my fundamental rights.\n\nThe right-to-work law gave me the freedom to choose my own path. Yet Michigan Democrats \u2014 who just retook complete control of the state government for the first time in nearly 40 years \u2014 have made clear that repealing the right-to-work is one of their top priorities come January. Governor Gretchen Whitmer and incoming leaders in both the state House and Senate are all on board. If they succeed, every Michigan worker who\u2019s left a union will be forced to pay up.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nTo me, this looks like nothing more than special-interest politics at its worst. These politicians look to set reward unions with a policy that will give them more money \u2013 money that they will then use to re-elect the same politicians. Even if you ignore this reality, the arguments in favor of repealing right-to-work don\u2019t add up.\n\nI was a union member for nearly 20 years, and I still work in a unionized shop. I know the arguments. They say right-to-work leads to \"free loaders\" who get the benefits of union membership without paying the dues. But under this law, unions actually have to show value to workers to convince them to stick around. Without right-to-work, unions are the real free loaders, taking workers\u2019 dues without having to earn them.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThere\u2019s also a lot more to the story. I don\u2019t want to pay dues to a union that\u2019s been under a federal corruption investigation for nearly a decade, leading to multiple convictions for embezzlement. And I don\u2019t want to lose the same workplace freedom that government workers have under the Constitution. Public-sector workers are free to leave their union and keep their job. Private-sector workers deserve the same respect. Anything less is both insulting and unjust.\n\nIt remains to be seen if Michigan\u2019s leaders have the votes to repeal the freedom that I and millions of fellow workers enjoy, whether at the Rawsonville plant or any other shop. I will always remember the day I gained my freedom. I hope I never have to remember the day it got taken away."}, {"title": "Inflation is \u2018taking a toll\u2019 on seniors, forcing them to return to work: 'The holidays are going to be tough'", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/media/inflation-taking-toll-seniors-forcing-return-work-holidays-going-tough", "tag": "MEDIA", "content": "A report published by the Associated Press Thursday highlighted the devastating impact inflation is having on America's seniors.

But the trees took root in American households only in the 20th century \u2014 in the wake of McGalliard\u2019s daring idea to farm a new holiday tradition.\n\nYet McGalliard is better remembered in his hometown of White Horse today for his role at the forefront of another American trend: suburbanization.\n\n\"The late William V. McGalliard is widely known in the section around Trenton, New Jersey, as the father of the modern suburban community of White Horse,\" reports a community biography shared by Guear.\n\nAmericans purchase about 30 million trees each Christmas, almost all of them raised on farms.\n\n\"More than any other single figure, he was responsible for the development, which changed it from a sparse farming district to a flourishing town, and with all the success of this enterprise as a business venture, he continued to be guided chiefly by his love of the community and its concern for its best interests,\" the same biography said.\n\nCHRISTMAS TREE QUIZ! SEE HOW WELL YOU KNOW THESE FAMOUS CHRISTMAS TREES AND MORE\n\nMcGalliard's two major endeavors would prove a more profound refection of America than he ever could have imagined.\n\nHometown might have been called McGalliardville\n\nWilliam Vannest McGalliard was born on August 13, 1857, in White Horse, in Mercer County, New Jersey, where he lived for his entire life.\n\nHis parents, Jane (Ivins) and David Cubberley McGalliard had married two years earlier. His father\u2019s family moved to New Jersey from Scotland during the American Revolution.\n\nDavid McGalliard was a respected local farmer, growing fruit and raising poultry. He served on the Hamilton Township Committee and the Mercer County Board of Freeholders (county commissioners).\n\nHe also served as deacon of the local church.\n\n\"He was responsible for the development, which changed White Horse from a sparse farming district to a flourishing town.\"\n\nW. V. McGalliard inherited his dad's industrious and civic spirit.\n\nHe served on several local boards and commissions, managed various businesses, built homes, farmed chickens and eggs and built White Horse's water works.\n\n\"Four years ago I put down a six-inch artesian well, and today I am supplying 25 or 30 houses in this suburban town, and have no doubt but I could supply 200 houses or more with the same well,\" McGalliard wrote in a 1911 letter to the editor of The Times of Trenton in 1911.\n\nHe also proved a pioneer of a unique brand of commercial agriculture.\n\nMost farmers rely on turning over crops at the very least every year \u2014 staging crops to produce as long as possible throughout the local growing season.\n\nChristmas tree farmers live differently; they're patient even by the standards of people who work the Earth. They can wait a decade to reap the rewards of their toil in the soil.\n\nMcGalliard's entire life unfolded just a few miles from where the most dramatic Christmas Day story in American history unfolded \u2014 the spot where Gen. George Washington crossed the Delaware River to attack Hessian troops at Trenton in 1776.\n\nON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, DEC. 4, 1783, WASHINGTON BIDS FAREWELL TO HIS TROOPS AT FRAUNCES TAVERN IN NYC\n\n\"If General George Washington hadn\u2019t [ridden] through the hamlet of White Horse way back in the 1700s, giving the village the name, chances are we would be calling that area McGalliardville \u2026 due to the incredible history this family has and had over the years in the area,\" local historian Tom Glover wrote in an online account of the community.\n\nIt would be another president \u2014 who ascended to the White House 125 years after Washington crossed the Delaware \u2014 to prove McGalliard a Christmas prophet.\n\nChristmas trees from White Horse to the White House\n\nThe New Jersey businessman found an unlikely champion for his vision of farm-raised Christmas trees: an 8-year-old boy in Washington, D.C.\n\nHis name was Archibald Roosevelt.\n\n\"Archie\" was the son of President Theodore Roosevelt, who arrived at the White House in 1901, the same year that McGalliard planted 30,000 future Christmas trees.\n\nRoosevelt was just 42 when he ascended to the Oval Office, still the youngest president in American history. He had six children.\n\nThe press corps and the nation were excited by the rare opportunity to see a young family in the White House.\n\nON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, OCT. 14, 1912, TEDDY ROOSEVELT SHOT IN CHEST, MAKES CAMPAIGN STOP MINUTES LATER\n\n\"There had been first families with Christmas trees in the White House, but it was not the modern tradition we know today\" when the Roosevelts arrived, Matthew Costello, senior historian at the White House Historical Association, told Fox News Digital.\n\nBenjamin Harrison was the first president in 1889 documented to have a Christmas tree in the White House, Costello said.\n\nIt was placed in the family\u2019s private quarters on the second floor, not on grand public display like Christmas trees at the White House are today.\n\nFranklin Pierce is rumored to have put up the first White House Christmas tree in 1853. Grover Cleveland and Ulysses S. Grant are also suspected of enjoying White House Christmas trees.\n\n\"The Roosevelts traditionally celebrated the holiday with gifts, church service and a family meal,\" writes the White House Historical Association. \"They did not celebrate with a tree.\"\n\n\"The boys decorated the tree in secret and even enlisted the help of an electrician on staff at the White House to help decorate it with lights.\"\n\nLittle Archie had other ideas. With the help of White House staff and little brother Quentin, they cut down a tiny evergreen from the White House lawn in Christmas Eve.\n\n\"The boys decorated the tree in secret and even enlisted the help of an electrician on staff at the White House to help decorate it with lights,\" the National Catholic Register reports.\n\n\"When Christmas morning came, Archie gathered his family outside the closet, turned on the switch, and opened the door to reveal the tree decorated with gifts for the entire family.\"\n\nThe Roosevelts became a Christmas tree family in the years that followed, reflecting the evolution underway in the early 20th century across the nation.\n\nBy the time of World War II, Americans by the millions celebrated Christmas with an evergreen amid their hearth and home. The tree-farming industry was now booming coast to coast.\n\nLt. Col. Archibald Roosevelt became an American military hero, serving in both World War I and World War II. He received multiple honors for heroism while being wounded in both wars.\n\nHis first victory came over his powerful dad.\n\n\"On December 25th, 1902, one man got the better of Roosevelt \u2014 his eight-year-old son, Archie,\" writes AtlasObscura of the event.\n\n\"And he did it all for the sake of a Christmas tree.\"\n\nA life worthy of poetry\n\nWilliam V. McGalliard died on April 2, 1935, in White Horse after several years of illness. He was 77 years old.\n\n\"His long life was one of useful accomplishment, rich in human values and crowned with the affectionate record of a whole circle of friends,\" according to a biography provided by local historian Guear.\n\nMcGalliard's legacy lives on in what\u2019s now a thriving American tree farming industry that raises boughs from coast to coast.\n\n\"The aroma of a farm-grown Christmas tree provides food for the soul,\" boasts the National Christmas Tree Association.\n\n\"His long life was one of useful accomplishment, rich in human values and crowned with \u2026 a whole circle of friends.\"\n\nTree farming fuels local economies and feeds families across the nation.\n\nThe four biggest tree farming states are \u2014 in order \u2014 Oregon, North Carolina, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\n\nNew Jersey itself maintains a robust Christmas tree farming industry, despite its status as the most densely populated and most heavily industrialized state in the union.\n\nNew Jersey has nearly 900 Christmas tree farms, according to the New Jersey Department of Agriculture. It ranks no. 6 nationally in Christmas tree production \u2014 a big number despite the Garden State's small size.\n\nMcGalliard\u2019s tree farm is long gone, now the site of the Kingston-Kemp Funeral Home.\n\nAmerica\u2019s most famous Christmas tree, at Rockefeller Center in New York City, came from McGalliard's hometown of Hamilton Township in 2008, notes Jeff Guear.\n\nMcGalliard unknowingly stood in a profound way at the crossroads of a changing America, one that left behind its rural roots for the suburbia he himself helped build.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nWhile fueling America's rush to urbanization in the 20th century, McGalliard ensured we had the color and scent of our wilderness heritage to put in our new homes to celebrate the birth of Christ, and other holidays, each and every December.\n\nSidebottom, the spokesperson for the National Christmas Tree Association, said the idyllic Robert Frost poem \"Christmas Trees\" best sums up McGalliard\u2019s impact on America.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"He proved to be the city come again/To look for something it had left behind,\" Frost wrote in 1916.\n\n\"And could not do without and keep its Christmas/He asked if I would sell my Christmas trees.\""}, {"title": "Pete Buttigieg blasted for taking Portugal vacation as rail strike loomed: 'Truth is stranger than fiction'", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/media/pete-buttigieg-blasted-taking-portugal-vacation-rail-strike-loomed-truth-stranger-fiction", "tag": "PETE BUTTIGIEG", "content": "Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg is facing new scrutiny over revelations he took a \"personal trip\" to Portugal in the heat of negotiations to avert a rail strike over the summer.\n\n\"The secretary took a long-planned personal trip from Aug. 29 to Sept. 5,\" a spokesperson for the Department of Transportation told Fox News. \"As usual, while traveling on personal time he remained available and engaged on urgent issues, which in this case meant multiple calls with staff and stakeholders to work on the topic of rail labor negotiations.\"\n\nThe \"Outnumbered\" panelists on Thursday sounded off on the Biden administration's \"hypocrisy,\" with co-host Emily Compagno noting Buttigieg\u2019s taxpayer-funded salary meant Americans were footing the bill for his time off while rail workers pleaded with lawmakers for paid sick leave.\n\nBUTTIGIEG OFTEN FLIES ON TAXPAYER-FUNDED PRIVATE JETS, FLIGHT DATA SHOW\n\n\"Do one or the other, but don't waste my tax dollars and my time with you abdicating your responsibilities,\" Compagno told the panel. \"And the people who pay for it are the members of that union that got a horrible deal.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, truth is stranger than fiction here when it comes to this administration,\" she continued. \"The optics of this are so poor.\"\n\nEnes Kanter Freedom, a former NBA player, said he thought the story was fake when he initially learned of the timing of Buttigieg\u2019s trip.\n\n\"I didn\u2019t want to believe it,\" he said. \"While your people are here are protesting, and you\u2019re going [on] vacation.\"\n\n\"I thought it was one of those \u2014 The Onion news.

The four dissenting unions, representing about 100,000 rail workers, said the deal was unfair because it included insufficient paid-sick leave time.

The three officials have previously worked in private and public sector roles pushing climate policies and have past ties to Podesta.\n\n\"We are fortunate that John Podesta will lead our continued innovation and implementation,\" President Biden said in September. \"His deep roots in climate and clean energy policy and his experience at senior levels of government mean we can truly hit the ground running to take advantage of the massive clean energy opportunity in front of us.\"\n\nAmong its main tasks, Podesta's office will be implementing the programs and grants included in the Inflation Reduction Act, Democrats' $739 billion climate and tax bill passed over the summer. The legislation enables the federal government to distribute more than $350 billion worth of loans and grants to green energy projects nationwide.\n\nHOUSE REPUBLICANS PREPARING TO GRILL JOHN KERRY OVER HIS OFFICE'S GREEN GROUP TIES, INTERNAL OPERATIONS\n\nShortly after assuming the role, Podesta hired Costa to serve as the deputy for clean energy innovation and implementation in his office, a position that makes her a deputy assistant to the president as well.\n\nCosta was most recently a senior adviser and speechwriter at the Department of State. Before that, she worked at a communications firm founded by Obama administration officials. And, between 2010 and 2019, Costa worked alongside Podesta in various roles at CAP, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and President Obama's White House.\n\nENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS PLAY KEY ROLE IN BIDEN ADMIN FOREIGN POLICY, EMAILS SHOW\n\nThroughout her career, Costa has repeatedly argued in favor of more government action to combat climate change.\n\n\"Relatively little direct federal spending today is aimed explicitly at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, whether through infrastructure or other programs.\" she wrote in a CAP report in September 2019, arguing in favor of using infrastructure legislation to fight climate change. \"However, it is urgent that Congress pursue all avenues to reduce carbon pollution and address climate change, including through direct federal spending.\"\n\nShe argued in a CAP report published years earlier that climate change would disproportionately impact low-income and minority communities. Costa added that lawmakers must \"take immediate action to curb the greenhouse gas pollution.\"\n\n\"The extreme weather events amplified by climate change have caused billions of dollars in damage, claimed hundreds of American lives, and traumatized communities in ways that will reverberate for years to come,\" she wrote. \"Denying these facts or attempting to sow doubt about the accepted conclusions of climate science does nothing to change the reality that American communities are living.\"\n\nGREEN GROUP INFLUENCING BIDEN ADMIN HAS DEEP TIES TO CHINESE GOVERNMENT\n\nCosta also co-authored a memo with the Climate 21 Project in 2020, saying the White House should hire a \"single, forceful actor with the mandate to lead the President\u2019s climate agenda.\" The memo made a series of policy recommendations that included a massive expansion of resources and series of organizational changes in the federal government to implement climate policies.\n\nThe memo concluded that the Biden administration would \"need to set ambitious goals,\" push an agenda that achieves net-zero emissions by 2050 at the latest and position the U.S. to lead the world in climate policymaking.\n\nIn 2016, Costa helped craft an op-ed for Clinton to defend the then-presidential candidate's opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline and has recently said that helping block an effort to repeal limits on methane emissions from oil and gas operations on public lands during a brief stint in Sen. Chuck Schumer's, D-N.Y., office was among her top accomplishments.\n\nIn addition to Costa, Podesta hired Cassady and Peck to serve as senior policy advisers in his White House office in October and November respectively, according to a review of online career websites.\n\nLike Costa, Cassady has worked on climate and energy issues in both the private and public sector. Most recently she was the deputy chief of staff for policy at the Environmental Protection Agency and was considered in the \"inner circle\" of the agency's administrator Michael Regan, E&E News reported in August.\n\nCassady also led Biden's energy and environment transition team in 2020. Before that, she was the deputy staff director for the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, crossed paths with Podesta at CAP between 2014 and 2019 and, years prior, was a registered lobbyist on nuclear and climate issues.\n\nLEFT-WING GREEN AGENDA BACKED BY JOHN KERRY WOULD BE 'DISASTER' FOR DEVELOPING WORLD, EXPERTS SAY\n\nCassady has previously taken progressive positions on climate change, arguing in favor of a carbon tax, implementing significant federal methane emission reductions and mitigating natural gas use in the electricity sector. Natural gas is by far the largest source of electricity in the U.S., according to federal data.\n\n\"In order to achieve a 100 percent clean economy, you\u2019re going to need a lot of tools. A carbon tax could get you there part of the way,\" she told Politico in 2018.\n\n\"By acting decisively to implement ambitious renewable energy and energy-efficiency programs, states can help ensure that the United States does not overcommit to natural gas and that it continues on a path toward decarbonization of the economy,\" Cassady wrote in 2014. \"Fuel switching does not go far enough to achieve the deep reductions necessary to avert catastrophic climate change.\"\n\nAnd Peck has an extensive background in health care policy and most recently worked at the Department of Health and Human Services. He has also worked for the HealthCare.gov initiative and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nAs a political consultant, Peck previously helped advise number of left-wing groups including Walk Free, The Rules, Rebuild The Dream, The Sum Of Us, the National Democratic Institute, Presente.org and the Citizen Engagement Lab.\n\nIn 2017, Peck co-founded Get America Covered, a non-profit organization that seeks to help Americans find health coverage, with Lori Lodes who has since become the director of eco group Climate Power.\n\nAccording to a 2018 investigation by the Capital Research Center, Get America Covered shared a webpage with and appeared to be sponsored by the Hopewell Fund, which receives operational and management support from the Arabella Advisors consulting firm and is part of a billion-dollar nonprofit liberal dark money network.\n\nAn Arabella spokesperson previously told Fox News Digital that the funds in the network hire them \"to provide HR, legal, payroll and other administrative services\" and that they \"make their own decisions on strategy, fundraising, and programmatic goals.\"\n\n\"John Podesta has built a talented team of policy and communication experts with prior government experience who are working day and night to implement the historic Inflation Reduction Act, which utility CEOs have said will lower monthly energy costs for American families,\" White House spokesperson Abdullah Hasan told Fox News Digital.\n\nCAP, meanwhile, has experienced increased financial backing from a large left-wing environmental fund.\n\nThe ClimateWorks Foundation, which Influence Watch describes as a \"pass-through\" entity that pushes money from Democratic donors to environmental advocacy groups, was among CAP's top donors, which the group posts to its website in monetary ranges. CAP's site says ClimateWorks contributed more than $1 million in 2021.\n\nHowever, ClimateWorks' tax forms show that the figure was $1.45 million, which went towards lobbying, project, and program support - a $1 million increase from the $450,000 ClimateWorks gave CAP in 2020 for project support.\n\nGROUP LEO DICAPRIO FUNNELED GRANTS THROUGH TO FUND CLIMATE LAWSUITS MOVED TO LARGEST US DARK MONEY NETWORK\n\nCAP also received between $100,000 and $499,000 from the Energy Foundation, which works to accelerate \"the transition to a clean energy economy,\" its website states.\n\nPodesta's CAP has deep ties to White House and Biden administration. Dozens of current government officials have taken on key roles across government agencies and White House offices since 2021.\n\nCAP's influence within the Biden White House began months before he entered office. In late 2020, a half dozen of the group's employees joined Biden's transition team in the Treasury, Federal Reserve, Labor Department, Interior Department, National Security Council, and Office of the United States Trade Representative.\n\n\"CAP attracts a staff that is smart and passionate about doing the hard work to create a more equitable, healthy, and just country,\" a CAP spokesperson previously told Fox News Digital. \"So, it's no surprise that we have dozens of alumni who have joined the Biden administration.\"\n\n\"We also have a hugely talented staff still working at CAP and many alumni working on the Hill, in state and local governments, and across the progressive movement,\" the spokesperson added. \"We're immensely proud of the contributions our staff and alums are making to meet some of the country's biggest challenges.\"\n\nThe influential think tanks' reach has only expanded since its work on the Biden transition team. As of mid-2021, nearly 70 CAP employees moved from the group to the administration to fill key posts, Business Insider reported.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nCAP president Patrick Gaspard, who previously acted as president of George Soros' Open Society Foundations, also enjoys a direct pipeline to the administration.\n\nGaspard has visited the White House a handful of times this year and has met directly with Biden, a Fox News Digital review of visitor logs shows. During another visit, Gaspard met with Richard Figueroa, another former CAP employee who is now a White House policy adviser focusing on race and ethnicity, his LinkedIn profile shows."}, {"title": "Media industry bloodbath: Insiders, experts on why Washington Post, CNN, NPR, others slashing jobs", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/media/media-industry-bloodbath-insiders-experts-washington-post-cnn-npr-others-slashing-jobs", "tag": "MEDIA", "content": "The media has seen a cost-cutting bloodbath in recent week with several high-profile news organizations slashing headcount as economic uncertainty and political polarization plagues the industry.\n\nDistrict Media Group President Beverly Hallberg, noting that layoffs are typically the first place media companies tend to cut back, is not surprised by the news across several prominent media companies.

Post staffers, part of a paper owned by one of the world's richest men in Jeff Bezos, hoped to receive answers on Wednesday during a town hall with publisher Fred Ryan.\n\nInstead of clarity, Ryan announced additional positions would be eliminated in the first quarter of 2023 and then refused to take questions from the employees of \"Democracy Dies in Darkness\" paper, saying he didn't want to get into a \"grievance session\" with the union. The Washington Post Guild blasted Ryan\u2019s behavior as \"unacceptable.\"\n\nCNN LAYOFFS CONTINUE WITH CHRIS CILLIZZA AMONG PROMINENT STAFFERS LET GO\n\nMorale inside both CNN and the Washington Post is low, according to insiders at both outlets. Part of the problem is how honchos handled the news.\n\nA Washington Post insider criticized Ryan for the way he handled the sober announcement, calling his interaction with employees \"awful.\"\n\n\"After the sudden layoff announcement at the magazine, I think people expected other shoes to drop. But to announce something as vague and disturbing as this\u2014and then walk away without taking a single question\u2014is arrogant and rude,\" they said.\n\nThe insider also highlighted how Ryan avoided questions from the audience despite the fact that his comments came during a company town hall filled with professional journalists, in which employees were presumably encouraged to ask questions.\n\n\"Terrible internal PR, bound to drive morale lower. And all self-inflicted,\" the individual added.\n\nGANNETT, CNN, WASHINGTON POST MAKE CUTS IN BRUTAL WEEK FOR MEDIA INDUSTRY AS HUNDREDS LOSE JOBS\n\nAs for CNN, Licht has been crushed by a series of reports from Puck\u2019s Dylan Byers, who used to work at CNN and is known to have many well-placed friends. Byers has put a spotlight on Licht informing staffers he didn\u2019t plan on making cuts roughly six months before he sent employees packing, although a CNN spokesman said Licht alluded to possible changes in the future and didn't know at the time that firings were in the offing.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery also pulled the plug on all live programming at HLN, a sister network of CNN, so longtime morning show anchor Robin Meade was forced out from the network she first joined in 2001 as a result.\n\nGannett, a newspaper juggernaut that owns dozens of local media outlets along with USA Today, began its latest round of layoffs last month. The cost-cutting effort impacted roughly 6% of the company\u2019s news workforce of about 3,440 employees.\n\nSimilarly, NPR, which enacted a near-total hiring freeze in November, has cut $10 million from its budget and ended its summer internship program.\n\nThe network's chief executive, John Lansing, said last month that he intended to avoid layoffs, and that he needed to severely curtail hiring. The network also cut back discretionary spending and travel, as part of the $10 million cut, which constitutes 3% of NPR\u2019s annual budget.

Instead, news organizations got on ideological, activist high horses. As a consequence, credibility ratings for mainstream news cratered.

Yet nothing could be further from the truth. Inflation is still crushing American families, and there\u2019s no financial cause for rejoicing\u2014a sad situation during the holiday season.\n\nThe administration\u2019s claims to be winning against inflation fly in the face of their own data. Since Biden took office, prices have risen 13.8 percent. In fact, prices have risen so much faster than wages that the average family has lost $5,800 in real annual income (i.e., what their incomes can actually buy). Conversely, real incomes rose $4,000 under President Trump.\n\nAdd on to that the increased borrowing costs resulting from higher interest rates, and the average family is effectively $7,100 poorer today than when Biden became president.\n\nBIDEN CAN'T PROMISE REPORTER WHEN PRICES WILL RETURN TO 'NORMAL': 'I CAN'T MAKE THAT PREDICTION'\n\nThe administration\u2019s fiscal and monetary policies are literally crippling people\u2019s livelihoods, but you wouldn\u2019t know that from the president\u2019s speeches. He now cites a 7.1 percent inflation rate as an achievement. Those same speeches never acknowledge the fact his policies drove inflation from 1.4 percent at the time of his inauguration to 9.1 percent in less than two years.\n\nYes, 7.1 percent inflation is better than 9.1 percent, but it\u2019s surely nothing to brag about. At the current 7.1% pace, prices will still double in about a decade. That is a horrific rate of inflation, and it\u2019s breaking the back of the middle class.\n\nNow the same president who told us inflation was transitory is predicting that it will be gone by the end of next year. Biden is always wrong, but never in doubt. The statistics from his own administration do not support that prediction at all.\n\nINFLATION EASES MORE THAN EXPECTED IN NOVEMBER TO 7.1&, BUT CONSUMER PRICES REMAIN ELEVATED\n\nIn every month of Biden\u2019s presidency, wholesale inflation (the price increases paid by businesses) has run hotter than retail inflation (the price increases paid by consumers). Businesses will be passing those higher prices on to consumers in the coming months, and that will continue to drive inflation.\n\nMeanwhile, the president has no plans to curtail Washington\u2019s profligate spending, which is the ultimate driver of inflation. When the federal government spends more than it collects in taxes, the Treasury must sell bonds to make up the difference. If the Treasury sells too many, it eventually runs out of people willing to lend it money at low interest rates. At that point, the Federal Reserve literally creates the money out of nothing and gives it to the Treasury.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThat devalues the dollar. While it gives the politicians more money to spend, a devalued dollar hikes prices for businesses and consumers alike.\n\nInflation serves as a tax, but it\u2019s a hidden one. That\u2019s why many politicians don\u2019t want it to go away. If you\u2019re wondering where the government got the trillions and trillions of dollars it spent over the last two years, look no further than your family budget. Every time you pay more for groceries or gasoline, you are paying the hidden tax of inflation.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDemocrats have displayed no desire to get the nation\u2019s fiscal house in order. And despite their political rhetoric, it\u2019s unclear whether incoming Republicans in the House will have the political will to tell their Senate counterparts \u2018no\u2019 when it comes to massive deficit spending.\n\nNevertheless, we have to have hope, especially at this time of year, that those in Washington will be persuaded to act responsibly so that this time next year the American people won\u2019t still be tormented by this inflationary nightmare before Christmas.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM E.J.

Instead, he responded that he is going to do \"nothing\" different because he believes his policies \"are working.\" The problem is that they are doing the opposite. Inflation remains high, household earnings have not kept up, and government debt has exploded.\n\nDelivering prosperity to the American people long ago stopped being a priority of the political left. In its place is an ideological zeal to transform America into a country where the income of hardworking Americans is redistributed to those who don\u2019t work, energy production is a scourge on the planet (unless done by autocratic foreign powers), and the government is responsible for paying everybody else\u2019s bills except its own. These destructive values are manifest in all the major legislation passed and the constant executive overreach. Despite the public\u2019s rebuke, President Biden and his progressive allies are doubling down on failure.\n\nConsider the recent announcement to again extend the forbearance on student loans into summer 2023. Already, this pause in payments has cost taxpayers more than $150 billion, and the latest extension could cost another $40 billion at a time when America\u2019s debt-to-GDP is at World War II levels, all to benefit college attendees who earn more on average than the hardworking taxpayers carrying the water on these loans.\n\nBIDEN APPROVAL RATING HOLDS UNDERWATER, JUST 28% SAY AMERICA HEADING IN RIGHT DIRECTION: POLL\n\nIf that wasn\u2019t enough, congressional progressives are looking to resurrect the anti-work child tax credit provisions that expired last year. The original, bipartisan child tax credit provided financial assistance to parents on the condition that they earn some money on their own. Under the Biden administration, the child tax credit\u2019s pro-work features were eliminated, and the size of the payments increased, turning the tax credit into another government welfare program. Permanently reinstating this policy would cost an estimated $1.6 trillion over the next 10 years, and a recent study has found it could push as many as 1.5 million workers out of the labor force.\n\nWhat makes these policies inflationary? As former Obama Administration economic advisor, Steve Rattner said in June 2022, \"We\u2019re all paying the price for having overstimulated this economy during the pandemic and putting too much money into people\u2019s pockets, which created a lot of this inflation \u2026 There\u2019s no free lunch, and we\u2019re all going to have to pay the price.\"\n\nAt the same time, the federal government has undermined economic supply by discouraging work and indulging a green-activist agenda of erecting barriers to domestic energy production.

Macy, the department store titan, was a Massachusetts native who opened his first namesake outlet in the Bay State mill town of Haverhill in 1851.\n\nHe moved Macy\u2019s to Manhattan in 1858. Macy died in 1877, the year before Edgar opened his Brockton department store.\n\nBut Merian suspects that the company, with its Massachusetts connections, quickly learned of the idea and brought the department-store Santa to Manhattan.\n\n\"Santa first became part of Macy\u2019s holiday season when the store advertised that Santa came to stock their counters with his finest gifts\" in 1861, claims the Macy\u2019s website. A spokesman confirmed the 1861 date over the phone.\n\nSanta appeared in Macy's for the first time the following year, the company claims.\n\nRegardless of any dispute, the real Santa Claus loves his global army of department-store doppelg\u00e4ngers as much as the children who flock to see them, claims McGarry, Brockton's parade-day Santa.\n\n\"Kids can now put in their request right in their hometown, instead of hoping to get a message to the North Pole,\" said McGarry.\n\n\"It has streamlined the whole process and made life much easier for Santa Claus.\"\n\nDepartment-store Santas have since been joined by a legion of mall Santas, airport Santas, street corner Santas \u2014 even a few bad Santas.\n\nTOP CHRISTMAS MOVES IN EVERY STATE IN AMERICA\n\nOne notably terrible Santa worked at Higbee's Department Store in Cleveland after World War II.\n\nHe famously kicked Ralphie Parker down the store's Christmas slide after the bespectacled local boy and hopeful Wild West marksman asked Santa for a Red Ryder B.B Gun.\n\n\"You'll shoot your eye out, kid,\" Bad Santa barked, while pushing Ralphie away with the bottom of his dirty boot.\n\nCity embraces Santa's legacy\n\nJames Edgar, the immigrant from Scotland who reshaped Christmas in America, died on Sept. 20, 1909, at his summer home in nearby Lakeville, Massachusetts.\n\nHe was 66 years old.\n\nKane, the local biographer, called him \"Brockton\u2019s grand old man.\"\n\nEdgar had suffered a stroke five years earlier, which limited his mobility. But he was able to enjoy the opening of a new retail outlet in 1907. It was the first concrete department store in America \u2014 an innovation meant to save lives by reducing the chances of fire.\n\nEdgar is buried beneath a giant mausoleum in Brockton\u2019s Melrose Cemetery.\n\nHis spirit lives on in malls and department stores around the country and around the world \u2014 and in the Christmas dreams of young boys and girls all year long.\n\nEdgar\u2019s legacy is best felt in Brockton.\n\nA plaque downtown marks the site today of Edgar's outlet, where he introduced the store Santa.

The numbers show persistent, widespread dissatisfaction with the state of the county and the economy.\n\nBiden's approval rating remains negative but is unchanged from last month's AP-NORC poll. Overall, 43% of the public approve of the job Biden is doing while 55% disapprove.\n\nWith inflation expected to continue into next year and fears of a recession mounting on Wall Street, nearly three in four Americans describe the economy as poor.

However, most people, regardless of party identification, regard their own financial situation positively.\"\n\nThe AP-NORC poll was a nationwide survey of 1,124 adults conducted via online and telephone interviews from Dec. 1-5, 2022. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.8 percentage points.\n\nThe poll comes after Democrats defied historic trends in the 2022 midterm elections. With all incumbent Democratic senators re-elected and Democrat John Fetterman's victory over Republican Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania, the party gained one Senate seat and will now hold a 51-49 majority in the chamber. Democrats lost the House of Representatives but managed to hold Republicans to a slim 222-seat majority, an astounding accomplishment given an unpopular Democratic president in the White House and a souring economy.\n\nBIDEN SHOWS STRONGEST SIGN YET THAT HE WILL RUN IN 2024\n\nBuoyed by one of the best midterm election performances for a first-term president in U.S. history, Biden advisers say the president fully intends to seek re-election in 2024 and has the full support of his family.\n\nA day after the midterms, the president, who is 80, said it is his \"intention\" to run, and said he is a \"great respecter of fate,\" and stressed the importance of his family\u2019s support\u2014specifically first lady Jill Biden\u2014in his decision-making.\n\nWhite House chief of staff Ron Klain predicted this week that the president will decide over the holidays whether to run again but said he fully expects him to announce a 2024 campaign.\n\n\"I expect it shortly after the holidays,\" Klain said during the Wall Street Journal\u2019s CEO Council Summit. \"But I expect the decision will be to do it.\"\n\nDONALD TRUMP ANNOUNCES 2024 RE-ELECTION RUN FOR PRESIDENT\n\nFormer President Trump has already announced he will seek the Republican nomination for president in 2024 to challenge Biden.

He grew up attending Detroit public school, and his mother worked multiple jobs to provide for him and his brother, Curtis.\n\nAlthough things were tough, his mother instilled in him and his brother the values of hard work, perseverance and faith. She taught them that through education, anything was possible in America.\n\nThanks to these values that his mother worked so hard to instill, Dr. Carson earned a full scholarship to Yale and began his undergraduate education there. After his time at Yale, he went to the University of Michigan School of Medicine, and then on to Johns Hopkins University for their neurosurgery program.\n\nAfter residency, Dr. Carson returned to Johns Hopkins and served as the director of pediatric neurosurgery and led a 70-surgeon team to conduct the first successful separation of twins conjoined at the back of the head. This famed procedure thrust him into the national spotlight as one of the highest-profile surgeons in the world, particularly due to his specialty in pediatric neurosurgery.\n\nAfter retiring from medicine, Dr. Carson launched a bid for the Republican nomination for president and served as the 17th Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Today, he continues his work as the founder and chairman of the American Cornerstone Institute, a nonprofit aimed at restoring the \"four cornerstones\" of American greatness: faith, liberty, community and life.\n\nDr. Carson is the epitome of the American dream.

Dr. Carson operates on the belief that if we just put aside all the noise and sit down with each other, we will soon find that what we share in common far outweighs our differences.\n\nDr. Carson is always good-natured, and any meeting with him is sure to have a few of his light-hearted jokes and quips.

Fueled by high levels of inflation, families in 2022 are expected to spend far more on energy and less on celebrating the holiday, including making purchases for loved ones.\n\nAccording to survey data by the nonpartisan National Retail Federation, the average consumer expects to spend $832 for \"core holiday items\" in 2022, including gifts, decorations, and holiday meals. That\u2019s down from $879 in 2021, a decline of more than 5%.\n\nThe expected drop in spending is due to increased costs for other household items, including basics like food and electricity. Despite the drop in Christmas-related spending, NRF expects overall spending during the holiday season to increase by 6% to 8%. That means families are spending less on Christmas and more on keeping the lights on and food on the table.\n\nECONOMISTS SKEWER FED, CALL SUGGESTION TO END WORKER PAY RAISES 'TONE DEAF'\n\nThe shift is mainly due to significant inflationary pressures. From December 2020 to the end of October 2022, the Consumer Price Index \u2014 a widely used measure for inflation \u2014 increased by more than 14%. Wages have also increased over that period, but not nearly enough to keep up with inflation. In fact, wages have declined relative to inflation in seven of the past nine quarters, according to data published by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.\n\nMaking matters much worse, energy prices have sharply increased over the past two years and are expected to continue increasing over the winter, eating up consumer savings.\n\nThe average monthly price for a gallon of regular gasoline in November 2022 was $0.29 higher than one year earlier and $1.58 higher than the average cost in November 2020.\n\nHome heating expenses are expected to rise substantially this winter too. For example, the Energy Information Administration estimates natural gas prices in the densely populated northeast will increase by 20%. In the Midwest, they are expected to rise by a whipping 31%. Overall, heating oil expenditures will increase by 45%, and electricity prices are set to rise by 11%. Those hit the hardest are working-class Americans.\n\nResearch shows that when energy and electricity prices rise, lower-income families suffer the most, especially in the winter. Racial minority groups are also disproportionately affected by price increases.\n\nThe driving factors behind the current inflation crisis are many, including the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine.

The development of Coronavirus vaccines created a high level of optimism among consumers and businesses, and the economy appeared ready to surge back to life.

Those hit the hardest are working-class Americans.\n\nThese spending and welfare programs have undoubtedly helped some Americans, but the resulting inflation has caused substantially more damage for many others, far outweighing any of the associated benefits.\n\nThis year\u2019s holiday season is the latest victim of Democrats\u2019 reckless policies.

But don\u2019t be fooled: at the end of the day, none of it is about social justice. It\u2019s about their bottom line.\n\nThis is clearer than ever now that the Supreme Court has overruled Roe v. Wade.\n\nIn recent days, in light of the ruling, many giants of corporate America announced they would reimburse employees seeking an abortion if they needed to travel out-of-state to obtain one.\n\nSome, such as the CEO of Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, claim they are doing this so their employees \"can access the same health care options, regardless of where they live, and choose what is best for them.\"\n\nHILLARY CLINTON SAYS OVERTURNING ROE V. WADE PUTS US IN COMPANY OF AFGHANISTAN, SUDAN\n\nMany legal experts have raised concerns that such selective benefits for employees are in fact a violation of American civil rights law. So why would corporations even risk it? For one simple reason: this latest round of corporate virtue signaling, like so many rounds before it, is all about padding corporate America\u2019s bottom line.\n\nThat\u2019s why I commend Andrea Lucas, a Commissioner on the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission at the U.S. Department of Labor, for opening three probes against companies that have extended these abortion travel benefits. This is likely the first such effort in the aftermath of Roe v. Wade being overturned.\n\nAs the former head of the Women\u2019s Bureau at the U.S. Department of Labor, it\u2019s obvious to me that it\u2019s cheaper for large corporations to pay for their employees\u2019 abortions rather than their maternity leave, or health insurance for their large and growing families.\n\nIt\u2019s really quite simple. If your family has no children, or fewer children, it takes less money to provide them health insurance. In addition, women without children don\u2019t need maternity leave. That\u2019s weeks, probably even months, worth of labor that the corporation will no longer lose.\n\nThat\u2019s why this latest wave of corporate virtue-signaling represents a perfect distillation of a woke ideology: publicly broadcast gestures of \"compassion\" and \"progress\" being used as smokescreens for what are in reality ice-cold financial calculations.\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t be surprised by this. During this year\u2019s \"Pride Month,\" American corporations re-branded their logos with the rainbow flag across their American and western social media accounts, but failed to do so for their Middle Eastern social media accounts. In short, they stood for what they claimed was right only in the places it was popular and, yes, profitable. In the places where it wasn\u2019t, they were silent.\n\nPRO-CHOICE PROTESTERS DISRUPT CAPITOL HILL CRISIS PREGNANCY CENTER'S BANQUET SCREAMING \u2018BLOOD ON YOUR HANDS\u2019\n\nThat\u2019s moral courage for you. That\u2019s the measure of corporate America\u2019s collective commitment to their supposed principles.\n\nUnfortunately, this is only part of a wider trend of corporations cutting back on both maternity and paternity leave. As the Wall Street Journal reported, while 53% of employers offered paid maternity leave beyond what is required by law in 2020, only 35% do so in 2022. Likewise, while 44% of employers offered paid paternity leave in 2020, that number has dropped to 27% in 2022.\n\nThe bad news is that corporate America appears to be full steam ahead on its current anti-family crusade.\n\nThe good news is that fewer people are falling for the hallow virtue signaling anymore. They understand its only purpose is to re-brand ruthless profit-seeking as socially conscious compassion. They recognize corporate America\u2019s hypocrisy in claiming to be \"pro-woman\" while at the same time being anti-motherhood. At the end of the day, while such policies may boost short-term profits, they are actually bad for business. They are turning off a large segment of the American population, they ruin the work environment, and it is quite possible that extending benefits in such a selective way is illegal.\n\nI\u2019ve never met Commissioner Lucas at the EEOC, nor do I know which particular companies are facing a discrimination probe. But this isn\u2019t about a specific company I have an issue with, or publicly stating support for a particular politician or friend. This is about supporting a government official who is focused on ensuring all U.S. corporations follow the law and do right by all women, not just some.\n\nIt is high time that commonsense Americans use every tool at our disposal to combat this woke corporate agenda that is not only anti-family and anti-woman, but openly discriminatory. While I commend Commissioner Lucas, the reality is that with the administration controlled by Democrats, it will be an uphill battle to initiate lawsuits as a result of these probes. Labor regulators across all 50 states must initiate similar probes, and ensure that American corporations in their states are not selectively extending benefits to only some women based on a pro-abortion agenda.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThis is America, where we believe in the free market, and the right of companies to earn a profit for their shareholders. But we also believe in accountability, and fair rules of the road.

They hope the latest \"ESG\" craze \u2013 which stands for Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance (ESG) \u2013 will fool lawmakers and the American people into believing that they care more about responsible investing than greedily making a profit.\n\nThere\u2019s just one problem: It\u2019s a farce.\n\nIf Wall Street really cared about \"ESG,\" they wouldn\u2019t turn a blind eye to China\u2019s human rights abuses, genocide, and military aggression \u2013 just to make a profit.\n\nTwo of the biggest culprits are BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon. Their two Wall Street firms publicly advertise \"sustainable investing\" efforts. And in recent years, they\u2019ve revamped billions of dollars in investments into ESG funds. According to Morningstar, the value of these ESG funds has increased to nearly $300 billion since 2017.\n\nCHINA PUTS THE WORLD AT MORE RISK THAN EVER BEFORE\n\nIn complete contrast to their public ESG rhetoric, however, BlackRock recommended last year that investors triple their investment in China because it \"represents a significant opportunity to help meet the long-term goals of investors in China.\" In other words, BlackRock is willing to help the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) meet its goals in exchange for profit.\n\nIt\u2019s time for Congress and the American people to see this charade for what it really is \u2013 funneling money to the CCP. That enables China to build a more modern, lethal military to threaten Taiwan, undermine U.S. national security, and subvert efforts for America to reduce its dependence on Chinese supply chains.\n\nBlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, has invested billions in China. And JPMorgan alone holds an estimated $20 billion worth of investments in China. However, the American people would certainly be disturbed to learn that many of these investment products are actually funneling U.S. investment to companies helping Beijing modernize its military.\n\nFor example, CSSC Holdings Ltd. (CSSC) \u2013 China\u2019s largest builder of naval vessels \u2013 is listed in several major investment indices that contain literally trillions of dollars of assets. In fact, Beijing\u2019s efforts to raise funds through capital markets has greatly benefited CSSC. The shipbuilding giant was able to raise $8.63 billion from debt markets by 2015, and has now launched China\u2019s new warship \u2013 the \"Fujian\" aircraft carrier \u2013 intended to rival America\u2019s largest and most advanced aircraft carrier.\n\nCHINA'S \u2018ZERO-COVID\u2019POLICY COULD BE XI'S UNDOING\n\nMuch of this came to light during a recent congressional hearing. Dimon was specifically asked about his firm\u2019s ties to China and what JPMorgan would do if China invaded Taiwan. Dimon and other CEOs eventually acknowledged that their companies would do as the U.S. government instructed if China attacked Taiwan \u2013 even if that meant halting business with Beijing.\n\nThe question, however, is why these firms would even want to do business with an authoritarian regime that has expressed an intention to invade Taiwan. And if that\u2019s not troubling enough, China also continues to use slave labor in the Xinjiang region of Western China. In fact, it\u2019s estimated that more than 80,000 ethnic Uyghurs were transferred out of Xinjiang to forced labor in factories across China between 2017 and 2019 alone.\n\nDespite pressure from the Chinese government not to publish it, the United Nations recently released a report on China\u2019s well-documented human rights abuses, including physical and mental torture, slave labor, rape, and forced sterilization. These crimes against humanity were a key focus of the recent congressional hearing with Wall Street CEOs. However, when pressed to condemn China\u2019s human rights abuses, Jane Fraser, CEO of Citigroup, simply admitted to being \"distressed\" by China\u2019s actions, saying that condemn \"is a very strong word.\"\n\nThe bottom line here is profit. Wall Street\u2019s pursuit of short-term gain comes at the expense of America\u2019s future security. Congress should immediately require transparency and disclosure from index providers and fund managers \u2013 and prohibit sanctioned and bad-actor Chinese companies from being included in investment products such as Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and mutual funds.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nTens of millions of American retail investors hold the stocks and bonds of thousands of Chinese companies, primarily in ETFs and mutual funds. These include companies that have been sanctioned by the U.S. government for egregious human rights abuses and national security concerns, as well as companies that are aiding and abetting genocide, trafficking in slave labor, equipping concentration camps in Xinjiang, militarizing illegal islands in the South China Sea, constructing aircraft carriers, developing hypersonic glide vehicles, and manufacturing other advanced weapons systems for China\u2019s military.\n\nThis massive investment is actively aiding the CCP\u2019s efforts to undermine our nation.

Even a cursory look under the hood of this report shows things are not as rosy as that headline number makes them appear.\n\nThe seemingly robust headline number of 263,000 jobs comes from the establishment survey of businesses, while the unemployment rate comes from the household survey. But the household survey also has a measure of employment, and that fell by 138,000. In fact, the household survey has been flat since March of this year, with essentially no jobs added over that time.\n\nIn the last eight months, there has been an unprecedentedly large divergence between the two surveys of 2.7 million jobs. One reason for this is that the establishment survey allows for double-counting, and the household survey does not. Over the last year, approximately one-fifth of the additional non-farm payrolls have been double-counting, not additional people employed.\n\nUS ECONOMY ADDS 263,000 JOBS IN NOVEMBER, BETTER THAN EXPECTED AS HIRING REMAINS SOLID\n\nThe double-counting can occur for different reasons, such as people holding multiple jobs. Many people are getting second (or third) jobs to deal with inflation, but the household survey counts those people as employed -- just like when they had one job. However, the establishment survey counts each additional job that a person gets as another payroll.\n\nThe economy has been hemorrhaging full-time jobs, losing almost half a million since May. That equates to an average loss of over 2,600 full-time jobs per day.\n\nConversely, unincorporated self-employed workers are counted in the household survey, but not the establishment survey. But inflation has caused many small businesses to close over the last two years, and there has been a trend for the self-employed to go work for large corporations. There is no change in the number of people employed, but the headline jobs number actually increases because the person merely shifts from an uncounted category to one which is counted.\n\nNOVEMBER JOBS REPORT BREAKDOWN: WHICH INDUSTRIES HIRED THE MOST WORKERS?\n\nIn fact, the double-counting in November was about 454,000 jobs \u2013 substantially more than the headline jobs number. It also explains the entire monthly divergence between the two surveys, which was 401,000. It turns out the economy might not have been employing any new people at all in November.\n\nnext Image 1 of 3\n\nprev next Image 2 of 3\n\nprev Image 3 of 3\n\nBut there are more chinks in the labor market\u2019s armor. Labor force participation remains weak and got worse in November. The low labor force participation rate is artificially depressing the unemployment rate so that even though the number of people employed declined in the household survey, the unemployment rate remained unchanged.\n\nMeanwhile, the economy has been hemorrhaging full-time jobs, losing almost half a million since May. That equates to an average loss of over 2,600 full-time jobs per day. This is particularly ominous because businesses\u2019 preferences often shift from full-time to part-time hiring before transitioning to layoffs in times of uncertainty.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThe manufacturing sector offers further evidence of this tumult. Average weekly hours and average overtime in the sector declined, a common forerunner to layoffs, while the industry added just 14,000 jobs in November. That is less than half the number added in October, and the slowest growth in a year and a half. While employment is a lagging indicator, manufacturing often moves before the rest of the labor market, which is clearly running on fumes.\n\nFor the average person who is working, their paycheck is bigger, yet they are demonstrably poorer. That is because nominal earnings continue to trail inflation so that workers can buy less, despite a larger income. People are resorting to credit cards to maintain their standard of living \u2013 an unsustainable path.\n\nYet another concern is the seasonal adjustment made by the Department of Labor to the monthly jobs numbers. Because certain months have predictable seasonal variations, the Bureau of Labor Statistics adjusts the raw survey data to account for these seasonal changes, such as large increases in temporary holiday workers who are then let go in January. That adjustment gives an estimate for the monthly change in jobs which was not due to any seasonal variation.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHowever, the adjustments this year have been unusually large to the upside or adjusted up much more than usual. But what goes up must come down, since the seasonal adjustments for a year essentially zero out; if one month is revised up by 1 million jobs, another month must be revised down by roughly that amount. December\u2019s downward revision will need to be 30 percent larger than normal to account for the unusually large upward revisions earlier in the year. In other words, this year\u2019s jobs numbers have been front-loaded.\n\nThe devil is truly in the details of this jobs report. The labor market is clearly turning from growth to contraction. Considering that employment is a lagging indicator, the economy may be closer to recession than many pundits think.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM E.J.

If he really cared, wanted to show that he cared about the work that we're doing and some of the sacrifices we have had to make, he should have stayed out of this or fought harder. I didn't want a strike, I know how bad it would be for the economy, but right is right and we need the sick leave days. The unions and rail companies have got to figure out how to work together on this sorta thing.\"\n\n\"This isn't for Congress to decide,\" he said. \"Whether you're for unions or not, we railroad workers should not have to continue the harsh conditions we are subjected to. Paid sick leave is a simple ask. For Congress not to be able to reach an agreement for some of the hardest-working people I know is just sad. I appreciate those that stand up for us, though, and even voted in support of sick days to be included.\"\n\nAsked whether he believes President Biden's call for Congress to involve itself in negotiations between railroad companies and the unions was a betrayal of the pro-union message that he has long touted, Ballew, who is also a member of BMWED Local Lodge 153 in Richmond, said, \"The president's decision to throw our bargaining round to Congress was not unexpected. We've been down this road before. It's how the Railway Labor Act proceeds.\"\n\nThough some of workers' demands were met, they had held out hope on the sick leave could be added. \"We felt like paid sick time off was an important omission and not an especially rapacious ask,\" Ballew said.\n\n\"Because of the 60 vote threshold in the Senate, we also know who likely cast a token vote in our favor yesterday because they knew they were insolated from its passage. There was buffer room there for certain politicians who have never supported our cause before to get a \u2018freebie\u2019 there, but railroaders are not dumb. We see that kind of deception everyday from our bosses on the railroad; we don't fall for that,\" Ballew told Fox News.\n\nBallew said congressional intervention \"could have easily been prevented if these miserly Class 1 railroads would have come to the table genuinely ready to negotiate paid sick leave rather than wait for Congress to bail them out.\"\n\n\"All of this was preventable and only came to pass because the railroads can't part from their antiquated labor-management practices and advance into modern societal times to afford a person the occasional day to address sickness when it strikes them or their family. A paid sick day is not a novel concept,\" he added.\n\nPresident Biden signed into law on Friday the legislation to avoid a railroad workers strike, concluding that the measure averted \"what could have been a real disaster.\"\n\nThe newly enacted law codifies a July deal negotiated by rail unions and the Biden administration that would raise workers pay by 24% over a five-year period from 2020 through 2024, including an immediate payout on average of $11,000 upon ratification.\n\nThe agreement passed by Congress was approved by eight of 12 transportation unions involved in negotiations. The four dissenting unions, representing about 100,000 rail workers, said the deal was unfair because it included insufficient paid-sick leave time. They had asked for seven paid sick days, but Congress did not include their demand in the bill, despite an effort from progressive lawmakers and even some conservatives like Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., and Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., to amend the legislation.\n\nAOC, RUBIO FIND COMMON GROUND ON RAIL UNION STRIKE: \u2018A RARITY\u2019\n\nAdam McKellips, a member of the SMART Transportation Division (SMART-TD) local 1289 chapter in Oklahoma, told Fox News Digital that he feels like \"we and our families are nothing but political pawns.\"\n\n\"I work for a Class 1 railroad that implemented one of the most egregious attendance policies (Hi-Viz) that requires us to be available to work 92% of the time per month,\" he said. \"If we take off one day for a sickness, we are required to [work] 14 days straight to gain points back.

Many challengers campaigned on rescinding concessions made to companies in previous contract talks, including cost-of-living pay raises, elimination of a two-tier wage and benefit system, and other items.\n\nThat could raise costs for Detroit's three automakers \u2014 General Motors, Ford and Stellantis \u2014 and almost inevitably will drive up already expensive auto prices.\n\nDOES SENATE HAVE ENOUGH VOTES TO PREVENT RAIL WORKERS' STRIKE?\n\nWith tallies from six of nine UAW regions counted, incumbent President Ray Curry had a slim lead over Shawn Fain, an international union official who started at a Stellantis plant in Kokomo, Indiana, in a five-candidate race.\n\nCurry had 38.6% of the vote, while Fain was second with 38%.

And nowhere is this more apparent than in California\u2019s government education system.\n\nSome 48,000 unionized graduate student workers at 10 University of California campuses went on strike three weeks ago, demanding \"significantly higher wages, expanded childcare subsidies, enhanced health coverage and other benefits,\" according to a CalMatters report.\n\nMeanwhile, government elementary schools in the lockdown-happy state dominated by teachers unions saw math and reading test scores plummet.\n\nCALIFORNIA RETURNED THOUSANDS OF PEDOPHILES TO STREETS AFTER LESS THAN A YEAR IN JAIL, 'SHOCKING' REPORT FINDS\n\nThese problems connect to the larger left-wing project across the nation, portending failure elsewhere.\n\nIn the 1970s, America saw a huge uptick in union strikes as double-digit inflation under President Jimmy Carter eroded wages. The higher wages won by unions in turn fed into more inflation since productivity gains didn\u2019t cover the increase in pay. It was a vicious cycle that pushed some manufacturing to foreign lands.\n\nCalifornia is seeing the same phenomenon, leading the nation with the largest strike this year due, in part, to it being America\u2019s third-most-expensive state in which to live. It trails only Hawaii and Massachusetts, with prices for basic necessities like rent, gasoline, electricity and food averaging some 39% higher than the national average.\n\nWith inflation at 40-year highs, people are finding it harder to makes ends meet. As a result, labor strikes, like the one in the University of California system, will become more widespread.\n\nThe vaunted UC system employs 48,000 unionized students to teach, grade papers, and conduct research. That might make some wonder what it is exactly that tenured professors do all day other than dream up new woke nightmares to visit upon the nation in coming years. As underemployed as professors might be, university administrators are far less productive.\n\nBy 2014, administrators at UC campuses outnumbered faculty, having grown by 60% over a decade during which student enrollment increased by 22% and the number of faculty went up by 8%. A study at UC Berkeley found 11 layers of management with 471 managers in charge of just one person. The number of direct reports per supervisor in the private sector ranges from six to 11. There\u2019s a good chance a few of those 471 managers are Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) chiefs with a social media assistant.\n\nIs it any wonder that inflation-adjusted tuition at state-run universities almost tripled from 2000 to 2020?\n\nThis administrative bloat has been fed by virtually limitless federal student loans with almost 43 million borrowers now owing more than $1.7 trillion. According to Andrew Gillen, Ph.D., a senior policy analyst at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, the average student graduating with a bachelor\u2019s degree carries almost $24,000 in debt.\n\nWith the UC system under increased pressure to not hike tuition, and with California\u2019s budget outlook swinging from an almost $100 billion surplus to a projected $25 billion deficit, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom and the legislature will have to look elsewhere. One rich source of money for the University of California are foreign students \u2014 specifically those from the People\u2019s Republic of China. California played host to 161,000 foreign students in 2020, 15% of the nation\u2019s total. Nationally, 35% of foreign students hail from communist China.

Black and Hispanic adults reported higher rates of food insecurity than their white counterparts, according to the report.\n\n\"In the pandemic, nobody had jobs and nobody had money,\" said Nancy Murphy, a 45-year old caregiver picking up a frozen turkey and groceries last week from a giveaway at the Redeemed Christian Church of God New Wine Assembly church in northeast Washington. \"Now they\u2019re back at their jobs but the money isn\u2019t going far enough.

However, many Republicans centered their campaigns on culture-war issues instead of focusing on the kitchen-table problems facing everyday Americans \u2013 and it made a difference at the ballot box.\n\nAccording to recent polling that was featured in The New York Times, voters over the age of 50 in 63 key battleground districts shifted away from the GOP, and Republicans went from maintaining a 10-point advantage to staring down a three-point deficit with older voters in these closely contested races compared to surveys taken over the summer.

The move could radically transform retirement investing for tens of millions of Americans nationwide.\n\nUntil now, those managing many retirement accounts were required to prioritize the best return on investment possible. By opening the door to left-wing investment plans, the Biden administration is permitting employers and private pension fund managers to effectively politicize retirement investments.\n\nUnder the new regulation, a retirement account fund manager or employer must continue to pledge to prioritize the interests of retirees, a longstanding requirement, but fiduciaries will now also be allowed to include factors like climate change and other ESG considerations in their analyses and decision-making processes. This will, by design, empower left-wing employers and fund managers to use retirement accounts to push leftist causes.\n\nThe regulation is a huge win for those who support using investment dollars to promote a left-wing ideological agenda. The total value of all U.S. 401(k) accounts was a whopping $7.3 trillion in June 2021. Although not all of that wealth will likely end up in ESG funds in the wake of Biden\u2019s regulatory change, if even just one-third of those funds do, it would mean trillions of dollars could soon flow toward companies that embrace liberal ideals.\n\nLABOR DEPARTMENT CLEARS PATH FOR 401(k) PLANS TO OFFER ESG FUNDS\n\nSome workers may not notice any changes to their 401(k) and other retirement options over the next year or two, but others will soon find themselves stuck choosing between a short list of ESG-focused investment funds, effectively requiring some workers wanting to take advantage of the tax benefits offered by 401(k) plans to contribute to beliefs with which they do not agree.\n\nThe Biden administration claims that fund managers that take advantage of the new rule are not abandoning their commitment to help retirees earn a profit, because they say that good investment decisions should take climate change and other ESG factors into account. History has shown, however, that ESG funds do not perform as well as those that simply try to earn the best return on investment possible.\n\nFor example, in an article about ESG investing published in the Harvard Business Review earlier this year, professor Sanjai Bhagat noted, \"To begin with, ESG funds certainly perform poorly in financial terms. In a recent Journal of Finance paper, University of Chicago researchers analyzed the Morningstar sustainability ratings of more than 20,000 mutual funds representing over $8 trillion of investor savings. Although the highest rated funds in terms of sustainability certainly attracted more capital than the lowest rated funds, none of the high sustainability funds outperformed any of the lowest rated funds.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nHow can you protect yourself from being required to invest in ESG funds? First, tell your employer, pension fund manager, or other fiduciary responsible for your retirement accounts that you are not interested in ESG investing. The Biden rule does not require ESG investments; it only allows fiduciaries to offer them.\n\nSecond, the new Biden rule permits employers to make an ESG fund the default option for employees enrolled in 401(k) accounts. That means that employees who normally do not voluntarily elect specific 401(k) investments could soon have their hard-earned money automatically invested in an ESG fund. Many workers won\u2019t even notice the change. If you want to avoid this from happening in the coming years, be sure to submit your own 401(k) elections.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThird, if your employer or pension manager severely limits your options so that ESG investing is hard to avoid when contributing to a 401(k), consider other investment opportunities that would put you in greater control of your money. An individual retirement account, commonly known as an IRA, could be a better option, for example.\n\nBiden\u2019s latest regulatory change is designed to funnel more money, potentially trillions of dollars, toward causes he and other progressives support.

Should we take any of this hand-wringing seriously?\n\n\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk recently tweeted, \"A collapsing birth rate is the biggest danger civilization faces by far.\" He continued, \"Far too many people are under the illusion that Earth is overpopulated, even though birth rate trends are so obviously headed to population collapse.\"\n\nMusk has been issuing such warnings for years, with some commentators ridiculing him in return.\n\nSPERM COUNTS AND CONCENTRATIONS DECLINING GLOBALLY SINCE 1970S BUT FERTILITY IMPLICATIONS UNKNOWN: STUDY\n\nMusk often does not elaborate further, except for stating the obvious: no people, no future. Or as he tweeted earlier this year, \"unless something changes to cause the birth rate to exceed the death rate, Japan will eventually cease to exist. This would be a great loss for the world.\" He makes a good point.\n\n\n\nAn average fertility rate of 2.1 children per woman per lifetime is needed to keep population at a replacement level. And while it is true that the world\u2019s population is still expanding, fertility rates in many of the world\u2019s most advanced nations are indeed collapsing.\n\nThe Japanese fertility rate, for example, is 1.4. It is 0.9 in South Korea, 1.2 in Spain and 1.3 in Italy. The world\u2019s population, in the meantime, will likely peak at 9.8 billion people at around 2080 and fall to 9.5 billion by 2100 in the medium-fertility scenario calculated by demographer Wolfgang Lutz and his colleagues at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis.\n\nDoes population growth matter beyond Musk\u2019s existential concerns? Yes, because population and economic growth rates are intimately connected.\n\nPrior to 1750, the Bank of England found that the global GDP growth per person averaged 0.01%, thus doubling every 6,000 years. Since 1750, it averaged 1.5%, thus doubling every 50 years. It is not coincidental, my co-author and I argue in \"Superabundance: The Story of Population Growth, Innovation, and Human Flourishing on an Infinitely Bountiful Planet,\" that the growth in GDP per person went hand-in-hand with population growth, which languished around 0.5 billion between the time of Christ and the 1600s, rose to 1 billion in 1800, and exploded to 8 billion in 2022.\n\nCHINA'S POPULATION EXPECTED TO DIP AHEAD OF 2025: OFFICIAL\n\nThe key to understanding the connection between population and economic growth rates rests in the crucial role played by innovation.\n\nIn his 2016 book, \"A Culture of Growth: The Origins of the Modern Economy,\" Northwestern University economic historian Joel Mokyr distinguished between (Adam) \"Smithian\" growth that\u2019s based on the division of labor and trade, and (Joseph) \"Schumpeterian\" growth that\u2019s based on \"creative destruction\" and new ideas. To appreciate the difference, think of the output of a miner wielding a pickaxe and a miner using an electric drill. To be sure, people have always innovated (just think of the eyeglasses that were developed in Northern Italy in the 13th century). But a period of sustained innovation, which separates the last 200 years from the previous millennia, is truly new.\n\nIn our book, we examined the prices of hundreds of commodities, goods and services spanning two centuries. This analysis found that everything from food and fuel to minerals and metals became much more abundant as the population grew. That was especially true when we looked at \"time prices,\" which represent the length of time that people must work to buy something. In fact, our analysis of 18 randomly chosen datasets going back to 1850 suggests that every 1% increase in population reduces the time price of goods and services by over 1%. Furthermore, we found that abundance increased faster than the population \u2013 a relationship that we call \"superabundance.\"\n\n\n\nThe day may come when artificial intelligence starts producing new ideas. In the meantime, we must rely on the human brain. As the British author Matt Ridley wrote in his 2020 book, \"How Innovation Works: And Why It Flourishes in Freedom,\" \"Innovation is the most important fact about the modern world, but one of the least well understood.\" What we can say is that a population of 1 billion is sure to produce fewer useful ideas than a population of 10 billion, and that would retard economic growth.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nBut large populations are not enough to sustain superabundance \u2013 just think of the poverty in China and India before liberalization. To innovate, people must be allowed to think, speak, publish, associate and disagree. They must be allowed to save, invest, trade and profit.\n\nThe threat to humanity, therefore, goes beyond our collapsing fertility rates. Superabundance also depends on human freedom and equal dignity, which started in Western Europe during the Enlightenment and then spread elsewhere.\n\nTo the extent that freedom and dignity are in retreat, and the values of the Enlightenment are under attack, we should all share Elon Musk\u2019s concern over the future of our species."}, {"title": "SEE IT: Christmas trees will needle buyers this season with prices expected to rise", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/see-christmas-trees-needle-buyers-season-prices-expected-rise", "tag": "DIGITAL ORIGINALS", "content": "Americans should expect Christmas trees to cost more this year, and they may want to buy their spruces early, according to a survey of wholesale growers.\n\nInflation hit 7.7% in October, and Christmas tree growers weren\u2019t spared with gasoline, diesel and fertilizer prices soaring.

They have lured Black households into dependency and long-term poverty, rewarded single-parenthood and led to the gnawing gap in home ownership and wealth between White and Black households.\n\nOur housing policies have had all these deleterious effects in a series of ways: by destroying Black neighborhoods filled with Black-owned businesses and homeowners but labeled as slums; by replacing them with public housing projects where no ownership was possible and Blacks were and are over-represented; by setting housing rules such that both increasing income and marriage are punished; and by defining affordable housing as subsidized rentals rather than small, privately-owned homes whose ownership builds wealth.\n\nRENT STABILIZATION, AFFORDABLE HOUSING MEASURES APPROVED ACROSS SEVERAL US CITIES\n\nI\u2019ll take these series of mistakes one at a time.\n\nLet\u2019s start by going back to the Franklin Roosevelt administration and the National Housing Act of 1937. The progressives of the New Deal were convinced that the private housing market was doomed to fail the majority of the population\u2014and that government should step in to build and manage replacement housing called public housing.\n\nFirst lady Eleanor Roosevelt pushed especially hard for housing projects for African Americans, convinced that the segregated Black neighborhoods of that era needed to be replaced. She even came to Detroit to cut the ribbon on the first public housing project, named for Frederick Douglas.\n\nBut housing progressives utterly misjudged what they were replacing.\n\nAlthough we are often told that Black neighborhoods were substandard areas owned by White slumlords, Census records tell a different story.\n\nIn Detroit, the Douglas Houses and later its companion the Brewster Houses, replaced a neighborhood known as \"Black Bottom\" (for its soil not its race) that was home to no less than 300 Black-owned businesses, a significant percentage of one, two and three-family homeowners, a thriving branch of the Urban League and other self-help groups, and, of course, many churches\u2014including the Bethel AME, led by the Rev. C.L. Franklin.\n\nI don\u2019t have to tell this group who he, or his daughter [Aretha Franklin] was, or remind you of the power of his sermon, \"The Eagle Stirreth Her Nest\" and its message of the way strength and grace can overcome oppression.\n\nWhen the time arrives, the eagle takes her young upon her back out of the nest and then dives sharply down, leaving them learning to fly, only to swoop down to protect them if needed.\n\nWe have followed a housing policy path that has led us to a dead-end of impoverishment, especially for African Americans.\n\n\"God does us like that sometimes\" when we are in too \"comfortable a nest of circumstances\" and \"we don\u2019t bother to struggle, we get comfortable right where we are.\"\n\nEven the history of slavery could, preached the Rev. Franklin, be overcome. Four hundred years was just a little while with God, he preached.\n\nThe great migration from South to North, he preached in his church, that would be demolished by the government, was God stirring the nest.\n\nLet me add this morning of the day when Yom Kippur begins that I\u2019m proud, as a Jew, that Rev. Franklin found inspiration in the story of the Hebrews from the Book of Deuteronomy.\n\nGEORGIA STOPS ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS FROM PEOPLE ASKING FOR RENT ASSISTANCE\n\nAll the effort that built Black Bottom aimed toward that goal of struggling toward self-improvement\u2014and was, by 1950, left as nothing more than vacant lots, a highway and high-rises which deteriorated so quickly that would have to be demolished themselves.\n\nThe same story of community destruction and high-rise hells would play out in African-American neighborhoods across the country: East Harlem, Central Avenue in Cleveland, Desoto-Carr in St. Louis, Bronzeville in Chicago. In St. Louis, the high-rises of the Pruitt-Igoe projects won an architectural award when they opened in 1956\u2014and were literally imploded in 1971.\n\nWhat should Mrs. Roosevelt have done instead? Improvements to homes that lacked amenities, rather than tearing them down. A Fair Housing Law that would have permitted Black owners to move up and out, to be followed by a new generation of owners building wealth.\n\nNone of that happened until the Fair Housing Act of 1968, by which time Blacks would have long since been steered into the alleged reward of the projects.\n\nToday, even as African Americans comprise 13 percent of the U.S. population, they are 48 percent of public and subsidized housing.\n\nBut isn\u2019t that a benefit? A way to reduce poverty? No, just the opposite. Consider the rules which govern public housing and its close cousin Section 8 voucher housing, in which government pays most of the rent for a private apartment.\n\nFirst, there\u2019s the matter of how to qualify.\n\nCALIFORNIA\u2019S HOMELESSNESS CRISIS HAMSTRUNG BY EXPENSIVE LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY\n\nThe poorest households get priority\u2014and that means single-parent households, almost always single mothers, go to the head of the line. Today in public housing, only 4 percent of households are comprised of children with two parents.\n\nWe all know that the life prospects of low-income single parents are not positive. But even those who would seek to improve themselves are, instead, punished. By rule, subsidized tenants pay 30 percent of their income in rent.\n\nThat may sound like a good deal until you look closely: it means that if your income goes up, well so does your rent. Who would ever sign a lease like that in the private market? It\u2019s not a ticket out of poverty but a shackle that keeps one in it.\n\nToday in public housing, only 4 percent of households are comprised of children with two parents.\n\nAll this affordable housing, this government benefit, remains a temptation, luring one into dependency. The promise of physical comfort distracts from the struggle that leads gradually to accomplishment and achievement.\n\nThe fact that some projects are new and yet to deteriorate should not distract us from their fundamental invitation to dependency. Here\u2019s a figure for you: the average time residents have spent in New York City public housing is 23 years. There are some residents who have lived their entire life in the projects.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThe growth that comes with going to Home Depot to get the materials to do your own house repairs is denied them; they are taught to be supplicants begging for basic services.\n\nWhere does that leave us today? For one thing, we must signal to public officials that they need to stop doing anyone the false favor of trapping them in the gilded cage of subsidized housing. But what can be done to rebuild and restore neighborhoods, those marked by vacant lots and food deserts? History\u2014the history of Black Bottom\u2014needs to be our guide.\n\nRather than building high-rise apartments on those vacant lots, we need to make sure our local laws permit the construction of homes that local residents can afford naturally\u2014because they are modest homes on small lots, starter houses, maybe two or three-families, maybe paying the mortgage by taking in lodgers.\n\nSome of those homes should have storefronts on the ground floors, where grocery stores and small businesses such as barber shops can set up shop.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nI\u2019m trying to paint a picture here\u2014of a real neighborhood, one where there are people on the streets and kids walking to school in safety. Where wealth is created not by checks from the government but through ownership and appreciation.\n\nWe have, I\u2019m arguing, followed a housing policy path that has led us to a dead-end of impoverishment, especially for African Americans. We need to rethink\u2014and re-do.

Some of us never find it. Michelle and Eric Smith found theirs in a Jacksonville, North Carolina, coffee shop that sits several hundred feet from where many of the storied Montford Point Marines are buried. When the wife and husband team began Brewed Downtown nine years ago and gradually built it up into a solid business, they could not have foreseen that they would one day be hit by a pandemic, a supply chain crisis, inflation and the ever-expanding corporate machine.\n\nWhat kept Michelle and Eric going was not money, though they certainly needed to earn enough to maintain a lifestyle Michelle described as \"not poor but not middle class either.\" Perhaps working Americans is the best way to describe them, and what kept them moving forward was community.\n\nI have to admit that I had become jaded with that word. I have lived in Los Angeles for the past 25 years, and the hardest thing to find there or in other urban areas is a community, or even a sense of one. Most of the businesses lining the streets where I live are corporate-owned, and their windows are often covered in ads trying to entice the dollar out of my pocket and into theirs.\n\nHowever, when I walked into Brewed Downtown for the first time, there was a sense of D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as Michelle rolled up to me on her mobility scooter and greeted me with a mug of freshly brewed coffee that hit the spot. Customers stumbled in, sleep still in their eyes, and they were greeted by their names. As Eric made breakfast in the kitchen, conversations were picked up from where they were left off last time.\n\nFOX BUSINESS POLL: VOTERS THINK BIDEN IS MAKING INFLATION WORSE\n\nI felt like I was back at my old coffeehouse job in Monterey where I worked the night shift as a teenager. Most of my customers were Army personnel from nearby Fort Ord, and I had gotten to know them quite well. It reached the point where I looked forward to my shifts so I could continue my conversations or debates with them. That job had become my community and, sadly, that job, business and community disappeared overnight when President Clinton shuttered Fort Ord.\n\nMichelle confided to me that she feared the business could not survive both the supply chain crisis and inflation. When the pandemic hit, Brewed Downtown was one of the few businesses to remain open. Workers pumped food out through the drive-thru window to their thankful regulars.\n\nAfter many months, Michelle and Eric thought they had seen the worst. Then the supply chain crisis hit them hard. Still, Michelle managed, finding substitutions wherever possible. She was determined not to cut items from the menu since her regulars had their favorites, but, eventually, it was slimmed down.\n\nWATCH:\n\nThen the prices began to rise on everything. She used to order 500 cups for about $50. Several weeks ago, that price rose to $148. The same thing went for lids, straws, napkins, flavored syrups, coffee beans and all the food items that filled the fridge and pantry.\n\nAs the days went by and the prices continued to rise without respite, Michelle and Eric saw their bottom line dipping into the red. How could they reverse it? They inched up the prices several cents, but 85% of their customers are Marines who make \"next to nothing.\" Michelle knows the life of service well; she is a Navy veteran herself.\n\nThen the bottom dropped out. Last August, she received a phone call from her sales representative at US Foods, informing her that the company would no longer be able to service her business. The representative said that only the top 35% of all accounts would continue to receive shipments. In other words, corporate America got theirs while small businesses were left to fend for themselves.\n\nThe sales representative told Michelle it was not personal. A fighter by nature, Michelle tried not to take it personally, but she couldn\u2019t help it. She told me US Foods got its start with small businesses and grew on the back of small businesses to become the behemoth it is today. Michelle felt burned by the disloyalty after ordering from the company for 50 weeks every year for nine years straight.\n\nMichelle and Eric did not hang their heads for long, since the only thing they know how to do is work and be kind to other folks. They began grocery store runs, extending their work day by several hours and buying items for the same prices as the rest of us. Their bottom line dipped further into the red.\n\nBIDEN, DEMOCRATS AND CHINA ARE TO BLAME FOR AMERICA'S STAGFLATION MESS\n\nTo make matters even worse, when they turned on their television in the evenings, they heard leaders who were either tone deaf or far removed from the struggles of small businesses across America. President Biden, who prides his Scranton working-class roots, announced that the Port of Los Angeles would be open an extra 60 hours a week to ease the supply chain crisis when it was already running 24 hours a day for seven days a week. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg blamed the lack of workers on the lack of child care, ignoring the fact there was a child care issue before the pandemic and people still went to work. Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen repeatedly minimized the threat of inflation even as prices continued to rise before her very own eyes.\n\nWhen I asked Michelle how she was going to survive, her eyes welled up. She did not speak of herself or her husband or the business. She spoke of the community. She told me about the woman that came in with a disturbed look on her face. When Michelle asked what was wrong the woman revealed that she had been told that she had cancer, would need to have both breasts removed and only had a 17% chance of surviving. Michelle then told me of the teenage girl who was so shy that she rarely spoke to anyone. Yet, for some reason, she felt comfortable enough with Michelle to visit nearly every day for lunch and conversation. There were many more stories that Michelle told me, stories made possible because of the community that she and Eric created.\n\nThe thing that I liked about Michelle and Eric is that they don\u2019t live with their heads in the clouds. They know that many people would tell them to just quit the business and give up. But quitting is one thing they do not know how to do, and one only has to look into Michelle\u2019s past to understand why.\n\nBefore she graduated from high school in Reno, Nevada, she joined the Navy. Her brother had tragically died from cancer a few years before and her parents were in massive debt due to medical bills. Michelle told them to take the college money they saved for her and her brother and pay off the bills. She would go into the Navy and make her own way in the world.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nShe worked every day of her life except for maternity leave. Even a motorcycle accident that led to the eventual amputation of her leg could not stop her. She and Eric found themselves working for a corporation for years and, like many fellow small business owners, they decided to take a chance on themselves, their American Dream. They knew they wanted to be near the beach and a military base, and they made their home in Jacksonville. Michelle told me she loves her town without reservation and cannot imagine herself anywhere else.\n\nBefore I left Brewed Downtown to fly home, Michelle gave me a long and emotional hug. Eric gave me a firm handshake that said it all. I was leaving two good friends and that is a testament to their character. When I returned to Los Angeles, I drove by my regular Starbucks and stopped at the small coffee shop that I had driven by countless times. The owner, an Argentinian woman, made me a cup of coffee nearly as good as Michelle\u2019s. What struck me was the pride that she showed in her coffee and the interest that she showed in her customers. These people make communities possible. We have lost many of these folks over the years, especially the last few. The loss to the fabric of our society will be profound if we allow more of these working Americans to fall by the wayside.\n\nEli Steele is a documentary filmmaker and writer.

It's really a spiritual spa treatment. That's the idea. We ought to do it more than a couple of times a year, but we are back and now that we are, an obvious observation: All prosperity in this country depends ultimately on energy. Our consumer economy runs on it.\n\nIt takes energy to make things and bring them to your house. Our tech economy runs on energy too, a lot of it. How do you think they keep their server farms running? Energy is pretty much, in fact the key, to everything that Americans do for a living. It's the key to health care and agriculture and yes, media and travel and construction, entertainment\u2014even finance, which is symbiotic with the real economy, depends in the end on energy, because you can't lend money to businesses if they no longer exist and if energy prices go up high enough, they don't exist.\n\nGiven how central, very obviously central, energy is to everything that matters in America, it's hard to believe that the Biden administration would intentionally make energy much more expensive, because we know for a fact, having seen it repeatedly through history, that high energy prices will crush our economy faster even than the COVID lockdowns did. People will become poor. Some of them will die. That's not a guess. It will happen. Given all that, it's unimaginable that anyone but our enemies would want to raise our energy prices to the point where our economy collapses and yet that is exactly what the Biden administration has decided to do and to do it, they're using twin instruments of climate policy and their war against Russia.\n\nThe effect? In a nation with the largest recoverable oil reserves on planet Earth, many Americans can no longer afford fossil fuels and once again, this is not an accident. It's not a natural cycle we're going through. Politicians and policymakers are doing it to us on purpose. Now that the midterm elections are over, the media can finally begin to cover the inevitable result of these policies. CNN, for example, just ran an article about Americans who are worried about freezing to death over the winter in America.\n\nHERSCHEL WALKER RECEIVED TAX BREAK FOR PERMANENT RESIDENCES ON DALLAS HOME\n\nOne 63-year-old woman in Philadelphia called Charmaine Johnson said that she is torn between heating her home and buying food and of course, she's choosing food because she has no choice. \"It's miserable,\" she said. \"It's like living in an igloo.\" Another man, a 67-year-old man called Tim Wiseley said he turns on his heat only when his teeth begin to chatter. \"You can't go food shopping and get oil. It's one or the other,\" he said. \"It's a horrible feeling. It's a feeling I wouldn't wish on anyone.\" It's a feeling that Americans have not had in generations.\n\nThese are American citizens living in a major American city that used to be considered first world and they can't afford heat and it's happening not just in Philadelphia, but everywhere. Average home heating prices went up 17% last year and they're up another 18% this year. Again, not organic. This is the result of policies from the Biden administration and its allies, not just in the Congress, but in think tanks across Washington and in the entire American news media. This did not happen by accident. As FOX Business has reported, once winter arrives, the problem is going to get much worse.\n\nFOX BUSINESS: We're riding around with Oil for Less and they say that their customers are struggling to keep up with these skyrocketing costs. Across the board, heating costs are expected to be high this winter. Heating oil in particular, up 68% year over year. Today, they filled up this tank with about $950 worth of home heating oil. A year ago, the same amount of oil would have cost them closer to $600. That's why the company tells me that some customers are just doing without.\n\nCHRIS PRATT ENDORSES BILLIONAIRE RICK CARUSO FOR LA MAYOR AFTER SEEING CITY'S 'DECLINE' INTO 'UTTER DISARRAY'\n\nMAN: People have gone without hot water and heat for a week just because they haven't had the money to call me and say, \"Hey, come on in.\"\n\nThey don't have the money for hot water or heat. Again, what country is this? Any country that can't provide hot water or heat in the winter isn't much of a country and again, it doesn't need to be this way because we have the largest recoverable oil reserves on the planet. What happens when energy costs continue to rise? Well, people run out of money and it doesn't take long. According to data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, households are spending their cash reserves far faster than anyone all those economists projected, even as credit card debt reaches historic levels.\n\nIf you're borrowing money for household expenses on your credit card at exorbitant rates, you're done. As Business Insider reported, \"Americans have already burned through a third of their pent up savings. That's nearly three times more than previously thought and signals spending will soon slow down.\"\n\nFAUCI EMAILED FRIEND SAYING MASKS WERE 'INEFFECTIVE,' PUSHED FOR MANDATES ANYWAY, MISSOURI AG SAYS\n\nYeah, that's what happens when people run out of money. They stop spending it because they don't have it and then the consumer economy slows. When energy costs rise again (Just to be clear, because it's not sophisticated economics here) when they rise, so does the price of everything else. The first staple to rise in cost is the one that you have to have and that's food. Watch.\n\nCNN: On the menu this year for Thanksgiving: rising prices. Overall, prices are up 7.7% from last year and grocery prices are more than 12% higher than a year ago. Here's what it means for the family grocery bill as you shop for the big day. First, the turkey. Per pound prices for turkey are up 17% year over year. An average frozen turkey costs roughly $2.38 a pound. That's up from $1.74. Now, you can blame the avian flu outbreaks and higher fuel, feed and labor costs because of inflation running near 40-year highs. What about eggs? Eggs cost 43% more than a year ago. Butter and margarine are up 34%. Flour is up nearly 25%. Your pies are going to cost more to make. These higher prices could potentially change Thanksgiving plans.\n\nWhy is this happening? Well, you heard the reporter allude to it, but not really explain it. There are, of course, many factors, but there are two big factors that are driving this , driving inflation, and the rising cost of everything around you and they are in order: global warming policy and the war in Ukraine. Now, as it always does, the left used people's best instincts, compassion and care for the planet, to subvert them into supporting these two lunatic policies. If you care about people, you support the war in Ukraine. If you care about the planet, you support global warming policy, but of course, neither one of these was about what they said it was about. Both of them were designed to spike energy costs, to increase the control of the people currently in charge, and to enrich their donors.\n\nHERITAGE LAUNCHES $1M CAMPAIGN TO RUN ADS AGAINST GAY MARRIAGE BILL DURING NFL, COLLEGE FOOTBALL GAMES\n\nIf you wanted to fix this, the very first thing you would do if you wanted to help the American middle class, would be to force a cease fire in Ukraine. That would help the world and it would help our middle class. Then you would encourage more domestic energy production because we have the domestic energy. Then you would take a look at the trillions we have spent on renewable energy, solar panels, electric cars and wind power. This has made a small group of people incredibly rich, but it has put our grid in per and it has raised the cost of energy beyond the reach of middle-class Americans, but the Biden administration is not looking for solutions, just the opposite. They're looking for ways to squeeze a few more dollars out of an increasingly impoverished American middle class.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, this week, \"the (IRS) says more auditors and upgraded technology could help raise as much as $1 trillion.\" Oh, so you have less money and they plan to take more. If that's not an act of hostility, what is? It is an act of hostility. They don't like you and they're not hiding it, but big picture, every other major company in America is laying people off, but the IRS somehow, thanks to Joe Manchin, the moderate from West Virginia, the IRS somehow has the dough to hire 87,000 new employees and they're coming for you. They didn't hire those people by accident. They hired them to take more of your money.\n\nBusinesses who have to forecast for a living have seen this coming and they're preparing to cut workers and so what this looks like, if you take three steps back, is an economic death spiral. Ahead of Christmas shopping season, when Amazon usually adds employees, Amazon is now laying off employees, a lot of them. 10,000 people were laid off from Amazon and the founder of Amazon, Jeff Bezos, is actually encouraging people, his customers, not to buy his products. Watch this.\n\nCRITICS ERUPT ON BIDEN AFTER \u2018SICK\u2019 COMMENT ON SEMI-AUTOMATIC GUN PURCHASES: 'SHEER IGNORANCE'\n\nBEZOS: The economy does not look great right now. Things are slowing down. You're seeing layoffs in many, many sectors of the economy. People are slowing down. The probability, say if we're not in a recession right now, we're likely to be in one very soon. If you're an individual and you're thinking about buying a new, you know, large screen TV, maybe slow that down. Keep that cash. See what happens. Same thing with a refrigerator or a new car or whatever. This takes some risk off the table. If you're a small business, maybe delay some capital purchases. Do you really need that new piece of equipment? Maybe it can wait a little bit. Have some cash on hand. Just a little bit of risk reduction could make the difference for that small business if we do get into even more serious economic problems. So, you got to play the probabilities a little bit.\n\nWait, so the guy who sells big screen TVs on the internet is telling his customers, the source of his personal wealth, not to buy big screen TVs off the internet, really? That's how worried he is. He actually, for maybe the first time ever, is caring about you. That's quite amazing and he's not the only one. Bezos is not the only one who's worried that something bad is about to happen to our economy, the global economy.\n\nIn October, the IMF warned that 2023 will bring a recession for most of the world. That same month, the CEO of JPMorgan, the country's biggest bank, Jamie Dimon, said a recession is almost certain in the coming months. So, what do you do to avert a disaster? Well, you probably can't stop it. You should know what its outlines will look at. Take a look at the housing market if you want to know. Home sales are at their lowest level in a decade.\n\nACTORS BEN SAVAGE, ANSON WILLIAMS RUN FOR OFFICE, JOINING STARS LIKE ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER IN POLITICS\n\nAs the Fed raises interest rates to fight inflation, mortgages become too expensive, but if the Fed were to cut interest rates, home prices would go up along with inflation . You see the problem here? We've reached the end of monetary policy ability to tweak our economy. So, faced with all of this, the one thing you'd hope is to have an administration that understands what the problem is. It might at least be interested in fixing it and taking care of the middle-class people who don't have a margin.\n\nPeople who are on the bottom, there are always the subject of our concern. What we do about the homeless? What do you with people who make $80,000 in the New York suburbs? Nobody cares about them. Here's Joe Biden explaining the straight face that actually everything's fine. His economic plan is working.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBIDEN: Folks, my economic plan is showing results. People are starting to feel it. We're making progress on bringing down inflation without losing jobs . Folks are seeing much needed break in inflation at the grocery store as we head in the holidays.\n\nThat's pathetic and everyone knows it's pathetic and maybe the only upside of the Biden administration is that there's really no lying at this point. This isn't working. They just did better than expected in the midterms, the Democratic Party, unfortunately, but we're now facing the next election in 2024 and no sane person wants Joe Biden to run because everybody gets that this is unsustainable. Even the media gets that at this point. The question is: who replaces Joe Biden and what can that person do about the disaster that his administration?"}, {"title": "Maryland worker's viral video pokes fun at punch clocks still being used on the job, TikTok users react", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/maryland-workers-viral-video-pokes-fun-punch-clocks-still-being-used-job-tiktok-users-react", "tag": "VIRAL", "content": "Social media users are getting a blast from the past after a viral TikTok video showed that employee punch time clocks are still being used at some workplaces.\n\nCadence Nicole, a TikTok user from Maryland, shared a video of the wall-mounted punch clock that\u2019s reportedly used at her place of employment.\n\n\"It\u2019s 2022 and this is how I\u2019m clocking in and out,\" the video\u2019s text-to-speech voice says.\n\nDAYLIGHT SAVING TIME 2022: WHEN DOES IT END AND HOW DID IT COME TO BE?\n\nThe six-second clip shows a pair of hands placing a timecard into the punch clock.\n\nFox News Digital reached out to Cadence Nicole for comment.\n\nThe video, which was originally posted on Oct. 28, has gone viral with more than 2.1 million views and 73,500 likes.\n\nTEACHER EXPLAINS WHY SHE KEPT A DISCONNECTED, 'OLD SCHOOL LANDLINE PHONE' MOUNTED TO HER CLASSROOM WALL\n\nHundreds of commenters have flocked to the post to share their punch clock memories, experiences and thoughts on work-hour recording methods.\n\n\"That's the way I clocked in and out in 1988,\" one user wrote.\n\n\"As a payroll administrator I would definitely quit if I had to manually add everyone\u2019s hours this way,\" another user commented.\n\n\"I quit a job with no notice once [because] I couldn\u2019t figure out how to work this,\" one user claimed.\n\nTIME MANAGEMENT: HOW TO BE MORE PRODUCTIVE AT WORK\n\nSome TikTok users viewed punch clocks optimistically.\n\n\"Baby y\u2019all better than us we\u2019ve gotta physically write it down,\" one commenter wrote.\n\n\"I\u2019d like that better [than] having to get on a computer to clock out,\" another user wrote.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSome users reported that they also still use the punch-clock method at work.\n\nOther time-recording methods that have been discussed in the comment section include fingerprint scanners and landline call-ins.\n\nThe inventor of the punch clock is Willard Legrand Bundy, a prolific 19th-century American inventor who was born in Otsego, New York, according to History-Computer.com, a computer history website.\n\nBundy reportedly developed the mechanical punch clock in the 1880s and he received a patent in 1888.\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\nThe invention of the punch clock is celebrated annually on Jan. 27, which is known as \"Punch The Clock Day,\" according to National Today, a national holiday calendar."}, {"title": "OR snowplow driver shortage expected to create problems going into winter", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/or-snowplow-driver-shortage-expected-create-problems-winter", "tag": "OREGON", "content": "A shortage of snow plow drivers has made clearing the roads in Oregon a challenge, according to the Oregon Department of Transportation.\n\nThe agency has almost 40 vacancies for seasonal and permanent positions on its road maintenance team in the eastern part of the state, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported.\n\nBILLS STADIUM BLANKETED IN SNOW AS BUFFALO PREPARES FOR GAME IN DETROIT AGAINST BROWNS\n\n\"We\u2019re trying to be creative with shifts and we have some days where we don\u2019t have coverage in the early hours of the morning,\" said Rich Lani, a regional district manager for ODOT.\n\nNew federal licensing rules for drivers resulted in longer wait times to obtain a commercial driver's license, which contributed to the driver shortage, the agency said.\n\nSOUTHERN US FACING FIRST ACCUMULATING SNOW OF THE SEASON, RISK OF SEVERE STORMS\n\nODOT will pay for new snow plow drivers to get the special driver's license.

How good does it feel? Do you go up half a notch on a one to ten mood scale, or maybe a full notch?\n\nLet\u2019s imagine a different scenario. You\u2019re buying ice cream from an ice cream cart, and take out a $20 bill to pay. Suddenly, a gust of wind sweeps it from your hand and into a nearby sewer grate. What does that do to your mood on the one-to-ten scale?\n\nIf you\u2019re like most people, you feel much worse over losing $20 than about gaining $20. That tendency is called loss aversion, one among many dangerous judgment errors that behavioral scientists call cognitive biases.\n\nLoss aversion is one of the three key reasons why our minds get sucked - and suckered - into Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales. Retailers know that our intuitive reaction is to avoid losses, with research showing this drive might be up to twice as powerful as the desire to make gains. By offering short-term sales, available only on Black Friday or Cyber Monday, they tap into our deep intuition to protect ourselves from the loss of the opportunity represented by the sale.\n\nBLACK FRIDAY: A BRIEF HISTORY AND LITTLE KNOWN FACTS\n\nLet\u2019s imagine a different scenario. It\u2019s Cyber Monday, and you decided to check out the deals on an e-commerce website. You go there, feeling confident you\u2019ll only get one or two of the best deals.\n\nBut once you visit the website, you\u2019re hooked. All those deals look great, with the prices so much lower than usual. You can\u2019t pass them up! So you end up taking advantage of a bunch of deals, and purchase much more than you intended to in the first place.\n\nWhy did that happen? Why couldn\u2019t you control yourself? It\u2019s due to a cognitive bias called the restraint bias.\n\nWe substantially overestimate the extent to which we can restrain our impulses. In other words, we have less self-control and weaker willpower than we like to think we do.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThe final key psychological reason for why you get sucked into Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales is because you\u2019re reading this article. Here\u2019s the thing: the abundance of news stories, advertisements, and social media posts around Black Friday and Cyber Monday makes it seem like everyone is thinking about sales on those days and looking for good deals.\n\nAs a consequence, our minds drive us to jump on the bandwagon of getting into Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales, a tendency that scientists call the bandwagon effect. When we perceive other people aligning around something, we are predisposed to join them. After all, they wouldn\u2019t be doing it if it wasn\u2019t a good idea, right?\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLoss aversion, restraint bias, and the bandwagon effect are mental blindspots that impact decision-making in all life areas, ranging from the future of work to mental fitness. By knowing about them, you can work to notice and address these problems.\n\nFor example, a useful strategy for Black Friday and Cyber Monday involves deciding in advance the purchases you\u2019d like to make if they are on sale and buying them online instead of in the store. For example, you might decide to buy a certain laptop if it\u2019s more than 20 percent off, or a specific big-screen TV if it\u2019s 30 percent off. Save the website pages of the laptop or TV that you want to buy, and then visit them on Black Friday and Cyber Monday to see if they\u2019re on sale. If they\u2019re not, be disciplined, and don\u2019t buy something else, as you\u2019re likely to get stuck buying much more than you wanted.

She does most of her shopping before Thanksgiving, with any last-minute shopping done on Black Friday\u2014a month before Christmas.\n\nMe, my plan is always to go shopping on Christmas Eve. But I don\u2019t really shop; I am a believer in the shiny object syndrome, and in the past if something caught my eye I\u2019d just buy it, and buy it fast.\n\nWHY THIS 'FOX & FRIENDS' CO-HOST IS GRATEFUL HIS WIFE WENT TO GET NEW SUNGLASSES\n\nRemembering how excited my mom was when my dad bought her a revolutionary new microwave oven, I was looking for that kind of emotion when for our first married Christmas I proudly purchased the very latest Amana Radar Range microwave.\n\nKathy was hilariously curious about what was in the big box under the tree, until Christmas morning. I was expecting a big reaction\u2014but got only, \"Oh. A popcorn machine.\" And that was all she said.\n\nWhen Kathy\u2019s birthday rolled around a few months later, I flat-out asked what she wanted. She remained vague until I mentioned that she was nonplussed by her Christmas microwave.\n\n\"When I opened the box,\" she said, \"The message to me was, Merry Christmas, here\u2019s a microwave, now make me something to eat\u2014fast, like a pound of bacon.\" I lowered my head, sorry that I\u2019d disappointed my new wife, while also oddly craving a rasher of bacon.\n\nTo this day the only caveat I have about buying Kathy a gift is that it cannot have an electrical plug, because the last thing she said on the topic was, \"Unless Hermes opens a small-appliance department\u2014forget it!\" She was kidding\u2026I think.\n\nRemember that book, \"Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus\"? That was the year I realized I Was from Best Buy, Kathy Was from Bloomingdale\u2019s.\n\nSo I turned to clothing. But women\u2019s sizes are confusing, and not wanting to spoil the surprise by asking her for a size, I\u2019d ask for help when I got to the store.\n\nOne Christmas Eve I was standing in a very nice store\u2014OK, the closest store to the parking lot\u2014and told the salesperson I liked one particular mid-calf coat. \"What size is your wife?\" She asked, to which I honestly said, \"No idea. But she\u2019s about your height!\" She then assumed she was Kathy\u2019s size and rooted around in the merchandise. \"This should fit her perfectly!\" I paid and was out of the store in six minutes.\n\nSTEVE DOOCY: I PRAYED A DESPERATE PRAYER TO GOD AND THIS SHOCKING THING HAPPENED NEXT\n\nThe next morning when Kathy opened the box, \"Fannnnnncy!\" she said as she spotted the designer label. This was better than I imagined! Then she lifted the coat out of the box--and seemed surprised how much coat there was. It was eight sizes too big. To make a point, Kathy had two of the kids stand next to her, and she wrapped the coat around all three of them, with room to spare. Feelings hurt, Kathy avoided eye contact and seldom spoke directly to me, except through the children, until Valentine\u2019s Day. \"Tell your father Cupid is dead.\"\n\nWord to shoppers\u2014when in doubt of a person\u2019s size, always buy small.\n\nOur next-door neighbor, Mike, and I had the same gift trajectory during his early days of marriage. He, too, loved practical gifts and had presented his wife, Judy, a wide array of Rubbermaid or Tupperware food storage containers and totes. His wife always used them, but it\u2019s not like she\u2019d brag to her friends, \"When you close the top, you don\u2019t have to burp out the air!\"\n\nI'M A 'FOX & FRIENDS' ANCHOR BUT I'LL NEVER FORGET THE HILARIOUS THING MY LATE FATHER DID IN THE GROCERY STORE\n\nThat all changed when Mike formulated a game plan weeks earlier and wound up hitting a jewelry shop on the upper level of our local mall. Even though it was Christmastime, he was in and out in less than fifteen minutes. When Judy opened up the little jewel box, she paused a moment, and blurted out, \"I love this! I love you!\" To mark their twentieth anniversary, he\u2019d gotten her a very pricey and dazzling diamond and sapphire ring.\n\nI thought I\u2019d never hear the end of it from Kathy. \"I wonder what Mike would buy me for my birthday?\" She\u2019d taunt me, \"Oh, I know\u2014jewelry!\"\n\nFor me and the other husbands in our neighborhood, it was not easy living next door to the husband of the year. Judy was over the moon and proudly wore her ring constantly, reminding everybody of how thoughtful, kind, and wonderful her husband was.\n\nSTEVE DOOCY'S LASAGNA GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICH RECIPE: 'BEST DARN SANDWICH OF MY LIFE'\n\n\n\nOne year later, when Christmas rolled around, the entire neighborhood was all curious how Mike would surpass the last incredible gift. Christmas morning, he presented Judy with a small bag from the same jewelry store as the year before. Judy could not believe her good luck--who says lightning can\u2019t strike twice? Inside, another velvet black box\u2014just as the year before. Opening it quickly, she locked eyes with a stunning ring that took her breath away.\n\nPositively dazzling and very expensive\u2014just like the one the year before. In fact, it was exactly like the diamond and sapphire number he\u2019d given her one year earlier.\n\nThinking this was a practical joke\u2014that he\u2019d boxed up last year\u2019s ring and re-gifted it\u2014Judy looked down at her hand, and there was the same ring from last year. Suddenly she had two.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nJudy shook her head in disbelief. The next day Mike had to do what I\u2019d done many times before--he returned the gift to the store, explaining to the manager, \"It looked familiar.\"\n\nAfter being married for 36+ years, my Christmas gift-giving plan is now unbelievably simple, because Kathy buys gifts for all the kids (from both of us)\u2014I have to buy gifts for only one person: Kathy. In November our youngest daughter Sally will start asking me what I think her mother wants.\n\nShe\u2019ll also look at what\u2019s out there and make a note of ideas from what Kathy says in their daily phone chats. Sally is very organized, like Kathy\u2014 which is why about ten years ago I deputized Sally to order all of Kathy\u2019s gifts. She ships them to our house and then discreetly adjourns to her bedroom, where she wraps them all.\n\nThen, on Christmas morning, I simply smile and nod as Kathy gleefully opens the gifts, which are technically from me\u2014although as she opens them, it\u2019s often the first time I\u2019ve ever laid eyes on them.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nI love Christmas!\n\nHappy shopping.

A solid education empowered you with this fundamental skill. Yet today there are literally millions of kids in our nation who are behind in reading and, sadly, too many who can\u2019t read at all. Your child may be one of them.\n\nThe latest data provide the facts \u2014 and they\u2019re alarming. The National Assessment of Education Progress released its latest 4th and 8th grade reading scores for U.S. students and found that nearly 70 percent of these kids are testing \"below proficient\" in reading and are in real trouble. That\u2019s not just appalling \u2013 it\u2019s heartbreaking, especially because most parents think their kids are doing fine.\n\nHow did this happen? In a recent podcast series, \"Sold a Story: How Teaching Kids to Read Went So Wrong,\" journalist Emily Hanford shared stories of parents who discovered their children couldn\u2019t read and the many challenges they faced in seeking help.\n\nRHODE ISLAND OFFICIAL SHARES 'EXTREME' VIEW THAT USING THE WRONG PRONOUN IS AN ACT OF VIOLENCE\n\nOne parent, Corrine Adams, realized her son in kindergarten was not being taught to read when she helped him with his remote schooling during the pandemic. When she turned to Twitter to share her experience, Adams quickly found parents across the country had children who were not being taught how to read either.\n\nThis nationwide failure is real, and it has the potential to rob our children and grandchildren of a chance to reach their full potential. To cite one example, economist Eric Hanushek estimates that students impacted by pandemic-related learning loss will earn 6-9% less income throughout their life.\n\nThe path forward is effective policy. It\u2019s why I founded the Foundation for Excellence in Education 15 years ago. Our organization recently hosted over 1,200 attendees at its annual National Summit on Education in Salt Lake City. Attendees heard from both Hanford and Hanushek and many other speakers in policy-focused discussions.\n\nCentral to our work is that every one of these solutions begins with what\u2019s best for students. It\u2019s why I strongly believe every child should have access to every educational option, similar to what was passed in neighboring Arizona with its Empowerment Scholarship Accounts program.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all. In Utah, leaders have already made strides to enact commonsense policies. Senate President Stuart Adams is a champion for accountability that grades schools using letter grades \u2013 so schools are held accountable. Utah Sen. Ann Milner has championed some of the fundamentals of early literacy policy that include literacy coaches, screeners to promptly identify kids who are struggling, and early intervention, monitoring and supports for students until they\u2019re on grade with their peers.\n\nYet in education, success is never final, reform is never complete. There\u2019s still more that can be done. It starts with ensuring all early literacy curriculum is aligned with phonics and the science of reading and disallowing failed policies. States would be wise to follow the leads of Arkansas and Louisiana that have banned curriculums containing \"3-cueing.\" As the podcast series I referenced earlier unveils, this failed method literally teaches young children to guess words rather than work on sounding out the letters and truly learning how to read.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nI don\u2019t expect parents to know this \u2013 they shouldn\u2019t have to. But there is an industry that profits off this curriculum, despite overwhelming evidence it impairs a child\u2019s reading skills.\n\nIt\u2019s time to put students first and put an end to what\u2019s not working for kids.\n\nBut there\u2019s too much at stake \u2013 we all must play a part to help every child rise. There are things parents, guardians, grandparents and any trusted adult in a child\u2019s life can do to help students recover lost learning.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nInvest just 20 minutes of reading every day with a child. And research has found an additional 30 minutes a week of extra math work have proven to help students make educational gains.\n\nAs a national problem, it requires a national effort. It requires a national commitment to education excellence for every child. I know we have it in our capacity as Americans to help every child close these gaps and ensure every child can access their God-given potential for a meaningful life."}, {"title": "Hakeem Jeffries, Pelosi's likely replacement, supports commission to study slavery reparations", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hakeem-jeffries-pelosi-likely-replacement-supports-commission-study-slavery-reparations", "tag": "DEMOCRATS", "content": "Rep.

We could be getting at least that much oil from additional domestic drilling. Alaska\u2019s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) alone has the potential to provide up to 1 million barrels a day, but drilling there has been blocked by the Biden administration since Inauguration Day. Here are five reasons why ANWR is a superior source of oil to the SPR.\n\n1. ANWR would provide additional oil, not borrowed oil that must be paid back\n\nThe SPR contains previously produced oil purchased by the federal government and held in reserve for an emergency. Because of the Biden administration withdrawals over the last several months, the SPR is currently at 30-year lows and at some point will have to be refilled if it is ever to be available again. Indeed, energy markets recognize that the SPR must be paid back barrel for barrel, which is one reason why tapping it rarely reduces oil prices as much as hoped. In sharp contrast, ANWR would of course never have to be refilled and thus could provide a genuine addition to oil supplies. It is like the difference between an unemployed person taking out a bank loan to meet expenses or landing a new job.\n\n2. ANWR would supply oil for decades rather than months\n\nWithdrawals of 1 million barrels a day from the SPR can only go on for a matter of months before the reserve gets dangerously low \u2013 in fact we are already there. But, as demonstrated by the fact that drilling around Alaska\u2019s Prudhoe Bay \u2013 the project most similar to ANWR \u2013 has surpassed 40 years of production, ANWR would very likely make a daily addition to domestic oil supplies for a long time. At its peak, ANWR is estimated to be able to supply a mean of 880,000 barrels per day and possibly more.\n\nPIPELINE EXPANSION IN PACIFIC NORTHWEST OPPOSED BY ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS\n\n3. ANWR generates revenues while the SPR costs them\n\nThe SPR, like all federal programs, requires tax dollars to maintain and operate. In contrast to the SPR\u2019s drain on government resources, the costs of developing ANWR would be undertaken entirely by the private sector. In addition, ANWR would generate leasing revenues, royalties, and income tax revenues that, by one estimate, could total $150 billion to $296 billion dollars for the federal government and state of Alaska.\n\n4. Unlike the SPR, ANWR doesn\u2019t strain existing infrastructure\n\nOne under-reported drawback to the SPR is that its storage facilities in Louisiana and Texas are located in the vicinity of an oil boom. As it is, the infrastructure needed to transport that region\u2019s oil to refineries, refine it, and get the refined products out to customers is already at or near capacity, with occasional bottlenecks. To the extent we would have to make room in the system for SPR oil by dialing back domestic production, the entire purpose is defeated. In contrast, ANWR oil would be transported through the currently underutilized Trans-Alaska Pipeline and could then be shipped to any of a number of refineries that need it.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\n5. Locals support ANWR drilling, but not SPR withdrawals\n\nIn Alaska, drilling in ANWR enjoys considerable and bipartisan support, thanks to the above-mentioned revenues along with job creation projections well into the tens of thousands. And, judging by their elected leaders, most Louisianans and Texans similarly support local oil production and see the Biden administration withdrawals from the SPR as a poor substitute for real drilling.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTo be sure, ANWR drilling cannot happen instantly. But the mere fact of so much future oil is on the way would have a beneficial effect on current prices.\n\nUnfortunately, the reason Biden prefers borrowing oil rather than drilling is the climate change-inspired fantasy that we\u2019ll only need fossil fuels for a little while longer before his \"incredible transition\" to clean energy takes hold. Tapping the SPR to reduce prices is a short-term fix that fits in with the administration\u2019s wishful thinking, while ANWR and other domestic drilling is a sensible long-term response to the pain at the pump, not just for today but for years to come."}, {"title": "SEE IT: Thanksgiving travelers faced major price increases for airfare, hotels", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/see-thanksgiving-travelers-faced-major-price-increases-airfare-hotels", "tag": "DIGITAL ORIGINALS", "content": "Thanksgiving travelers faced major price hurdles this holiday.\n\nDecades-high inflation, coupled with a continued travel rebound stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, is leading to higher prices for just about everything travel-related, including airfare, hotels and gas.

Under a more pessimistic set of economic and policy assumptions \u2013 where politicians extend various expiring provisions \u2013 we find debt could reach 138% of the economy.\n\nSome of the recent borrowing was justified, and indeed necessary, to support the economy during the pandemic and prevent what could have been the deepest economic downturn since the Great Depression.\n\nBut the responsible COVID-19 borrowing was sandwiched in between trillions of reckless unnecessary borrowing. Former President Donald Trump signed $7.5 trillion of new borrowing into law, or $4 trillion excluding COVID-19 measures. That $4 trillion was split about evenly between unpaid-for tax cuts and spending increases.\n\nThe Biden administration has continued the trend of adding to debt, approving about $5 trillion in new borrowing so far, including $1.9 trillion from the American Rescue Plan, $400 billion from the bipartisan infrastructure law, and the rest split between the irresponsible student debt cancelation, unpaid-for new veteran benefits, and other spending increases. Even when it came to COVID-19 relief, they went too far, spending far more than was necessary, which in turn fueled today\u2019s high inflation.

TRICKS TO HELP YOU SAVE BIG ON HOLIDAY GIFTS\n\nIf that guy on a small audience investment channel could tell that Sam Bankman-Fried was a fraud, where was Gary Gensler of the SEC and by the way, the tell in the sentence you just heard is that Sam Bankman-Fried couldn't explain where he got his money. Here you are, a 30-year-old billionaire, how did you do that? If you can't tell us that, maybe that's a red flag and you would think most investors would have recognized it, but for the most part, they didn't, nor do they seem to notice the obvious incompetence of Sam Bankman-Fried's business partner/girlfriend, Caroline Ellison.\n\nEllison was totally and obviously unqualified for the job she claimed to have. She had no track record of success at anything. She reportedly wrote online about her drug use and then on a podcast back in May, months before the collapse, Caroline Ellison just came out and admitted that she had no idea what she was doing. Watch this.\n\nQUESTION: Do you think that you have been able to pull this thing off without your mathematics degree or it has been the pillar of your trading activity?\n\nCAROLINE ELLISON: Uh, yeah, absolutely. I could pull it off without my math degree. I use very little math. When you start out as like an intern and you, you know, do something and accidentally lose, you know, maybe $1,000 or your desk, you're like, \"Oh, God, like, everyone's going to hate me now. Like, this is terrible\" and, yeah, over time, you have to sort of, yeah, get comfortable with larger and larger swings of money. Yeah, I'm trying to think of a good example of a trade where I've lost a ton of money. Well, I don't know. I probably don't want to go into specifics too much about.\n\nPAUL RYAN SAYS MCCARTHY WILL CLINCH SPEAKERSHIP, ANYONE \u2018NOT NAMED TRUMP\u2019 CAN BEAT BIDEN\n\nOh, I've lost a ton of money. No big deal. It's not mine and no, there's no math here at the cryptocurrency exchange. Let's send her billions of dollars! Lost a lot of money. A lot of money that investors, including institutional investors, including individuals who are hoping to retire with that money all gone because we don't do math, it's so outdated, but here's the amazing thing.\n\nNone of this seemed to face the biggest institutional investors, Sequoia. Their entire job is to what? Assess risk, but it wasn't really about risk and reward. It was about something else. Earlier this year, Michael Grimes, a former spokesman for Bill Clinton who seemed to be making an awful lot of money somehow in the financial world, approached Elon Musk, the world's richest man, with an investment offer on behalf of SBF. Sam Bankman-Fried wants you to invest.\n\nElon Musk didn't get to be the richest man on the planet by investing in things like that, so he apparently smelled B.S. and turned Grimes down, but in their exchange, which has since become public, Grimes multiple times told Musk that, by the way, Sam Bankman-Fried is a huge donor to the Democratic Party. \"Major Democratic donor\" Grimes wrote to Musk, second to Bloomberg and donations to Biden campaign.\n\nMINNESOTA NURSES ANNOUNCE UPCOMING STRIKE VOTE: \u2018OUR HOSPITAL LEADERSHIP HAS FAILED US\u2019\n\nWhat does that have to do with the investment? It should be irrelevant, but that was the substance of the pitch. What is this exactly? It doesn't quite sound like a business. It sounds like a hybrid of some kind and not in a reassuring way. Now, some of this was happening in secret, but a lot of it was happening right out in public, right in front of the news media and of course, a lot of them knew Sam Bankman-Fried because he was sending a lot of the money and when he wasn't, he was desperate for the publicity they could provide. Sam Bankman-Fried was on the cover of more magazines than Madonna. So, they probably should've been asking questions about his business, but none of them did. They promoted him. Watch.\n\nCNBC VIDEO: They call him the J.P. Morgan of crypto, right?\n\nYeah.

He's the Michael Jordan of crypto. Wait a second. Michael Jordan is not in crypto. He played basketball well. Sam Bankman-Fried is not really a crypto either. How are we all getting rich? Who knows. Don't ask questions. He's a JPMorgan. He'll be a trillionaire. So, why were all these people pushing a scam that any normal person, even a person with no background in finance and just sort of an elementary understanding of profit loss equations could have seen was probably going to collapse in the end? Now, we're not sure. Stupidity clearly plays a role and so does the herd instinct. All we can ask, really, is: who is benefiting from all of this?\n\nWell, we know that the Democratic Party benefited. As we told you, Sam Bankman-Fried donated $40 million to Democrats this cycle. That's more than any other donor, apart from Soros. Then he pledged another billion dollars for the next election. A billion in one election because that's democracy! He wasn't doing this in private. He was bragging about it and then he was going on in public about how politicians, Democratic politicians, were begging him for money. Watch this.\n\nQUESTION: So, how do you find political fundraisers? They come to you directly. Is it easy to get to you and say, \"we need this money for this candidate\" and what type of candidates you tend to support?\n\nSAM BANKMAN-FRIED: Oh, yeah. Well, if you, if I pulled out my phone here and just looked at my last ten text messages, you know, about half of them are going to be people asking for, you know, politicians asking for contributions.\n\nPROGRESSIVE FTX FOUNDER SAM BANKMAN-FRIED ADMITS ETHICAL IMAGE AN ACT: 'DUMB GAME WE WOKE WESTERNERS PLAY'\n\nSo why were you telling us this in public and by the way, if you're shaking like a naked man in a snowstorm in the middle of an interview, maybe there's something wrong with you. Send that boy another billion dollars. how substantial are we overstating this? Are we making a partisan points? So, things collapse. It was clearly a Ponzi. Are we trying to attack the Democratic Party now? No, it's actually justified. This guy was a major donor. Major donor! According to the head of Citadel, defeating Donald Trump was literally on the balance sheet of FTX. Watch this.\n\nBLOOMBERG NEW ECONOMY FORUM: FTX crosses into a zone that all of us are worried about. You know, on the balance sheet of FTS is a line called \"Trump lose\" And Sam was the second biggest donor to Democratic candidates.\n\nBLOOMBERG NEW ECONOMY FORUM: I'm going to leave it to everybody else to draw their own conclusions about what you're saying here.\n\nAnother reporter says we're out of time. We can't go too deeply into that. Really? Let's go more deeply into it. It's pretty interesting. So, of course, politicians love the guy because he was just a cash spigot and that's what they want most. Where were the regulators because there is a government that's supposed to be independent of office holders, a regulatory state that keeps Ponzi from happening? Where were they? Well, Sam Bankman-Fried was himself invited to Washington to consult on crypto regulations and then he posed for a picture with Maxine Waters, who's the head financial regulator in the Congress and then The Washington Post, who is the hometown newspaper of government, did no reporting on his actual business. They just wrote a puff piece about how cool it is that the guy with funky hair, can't sit still and sleeps on a beanbag is getting super rich.\n\nMCCONNELL EMERGES FROM SENATE LEADERSHIP VOTE WITH BROAD GOP BACKING: \u2018NOT GOING ANYWHERE\u2019\n\nHow did he pull this scam? How did he do that? Well, he did it with religion. That's the quickest way to blind people. If they think you share a common faith, maybe they'll do it and that religion is effective altruism. There are a lot of effective altruists. Maybe you haven't heard of that. It's a kind of religious movement. It's very popular in the tech world and the finance world throughout Silicon Valley and parts of New York.\n\nThe idea is that you make money not because you're greedy, not because you have a bottomless pit inside you of need that can never be filled, but because you want to help other people and you want to help them in the most efficient way. You want to benefit the greatest numbers of people in the most efficient way, so that means effective altruists get to underpay their housekeepers. They get to stiff the waiter on the tip, but of course, needless to say they do, but that's okay, because they're deeply concerned about abstract tragedies like global warming.\n\nSo, if nothing else, effective altruism gives you a moral cover as you rip off investors in order to live tax-free in splendor in some beachfront paradise, as Sam Bankman-Fried did and to this day continues to do. He's still in Albany and the Bahamas. It goes without saying that Sam Bankman-Fried talked a lot about effective altruism and return, FTX enjoyed a very high ESG score, higher than Exxon, which gets your ambulance to the hospital and your plane in the air to see your kids and heats your home.\n\nUS MUST CATCH UP TO CHINA\u2019S DIGITAL CURRENCY CAPABILITY IN ORDER TO 'LEAD THE WORLD': PAUL RYAN POLICY VOLUME\n\nSam Bankman-Fried was considered a moral leader even as he was ripping off millions of people, but no one benefited long-term from this collapse or will benefit more than government regulators. They are pointing to FTX and demanding more control over cryptocurrency and ultimately the end of the cash economy. Why do we think they're going to do that? Because they're already working on it. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce said this week the demise of FTX could be a \"catalyst for more regulation.\" Why should you worry about that? Well, because, as we saw in Canada last year, crypto is a huge problem for governments. Governments can't control, ideally, cryptocurrency. You can't freeze someone's personal cold wallet with crypto in it if you don't like what they say. What does this have to do with the collapse of FTX?\n\nWell, it turns out that Sam Bankman-Fried girlfriend\u2019s Caroline Ellison, has a lot of connections to regulars, in fact, the biggest regulator of all in this country. Her father, Glenn, is an MIT professor who worked at that university alongside drum roll, please, Gary Gensler, the head of the SEC, which is in charge of cryptocurrency regulation. FTX's general counsel used to work with Gensler on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Now Gensler is about to get a lot more power, so this thing swells to unsustainable size and inevitably implodes. It collapses and that collapse is used for a pretext to do what they've been planning to do all along. So, iy probably shouldn't shock you that right after this collapse, every major bank in this country announced a new partnership with the New York Fed to establish a new digital currency.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOh, digital currency, the one they can regulate and control. Citigroup, Wells Fargo, MasterCard, HSBC, all working on a 12-week digital dollar pilot. The Fed describes this project as a regulated liability network. What does this mean long-term? Well, if they have control of your money because it's digital, you can't stash it under your bed. If they don't like what you say, they can turn it off and you're impoverished. In other words, this whole thing is a bigger scam even that it seems and it was made possible by political sloganeering and Sam Bankman-Fried. If nothing else, he is not stupid and he knows that well.\n\nAs he put it in a message to a reporter the other day from his hideout in the Bahamas, the woke posturing is the most effective possible business ploy, and we're quoting \"I feel bad for those who get effed by it\", he wrote. \"By this dumb game we woke Westerners play where we all say the right chivalrous and everyone likes us.\" In other words, if you suspected all this was a scam, all the moral posturing, all the lectures you get about how they're great and you\u2019re bad, this was all the way to blind you to the fact that there was a massive rip-off going on, you might be on the right track."}, {"title": "Minnesota nurses announce upcoming strike vote: \u2018Our hospital leadership has failed us\u2019", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/minnesota-nurses-announce-upcoming-strike-vote-hospital-leadership-has-failed-us", "tag": "MINNESOTA", "content": "Members of the Minnesota Nurses Association (MNA) said Thursday that its members will vote later this month on another possible strike.\n\nThe decision to vote on Nov. 30, announced at a press conference, comes more than two months after some 15,000 nurses walked off the job after failing to reach an agreement with the hospitals over staffing and wage issues.\n\n\"We have been at the bargaining table for eight long months,\" MNA President Mary C.

That's why California is often one of the first states to have budget problems when the economy starts to falter.\n\nThe S&P 500, a key indicator of the health of the stock market that drives the income of the superrich, has fallen more than 17% since its peak in January. State revenues are now $41 billion below expectations, according to an outlook published Wednesday by the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst's Office. The estimated deficit is lower because some of those revenue losses were offset by lower spending in other parts of the budget.\n\nBIDEN AND CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS HAVE SPENT ABOUT $3.8 TRILLION ON THEIR AGENDA SINCE INAUGURATION DAY\n\nThe shortfall won't endanger some of California's major expansions of government services, including free kindergarten for 4-year-olds and free health care for low-income immigrants living in the country without legal permission.\n\nBut it will force some painful spending decisions, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom's administration said.\n\n\"While we\u2019re in fact better prepared, that doesn\u2019t mean that the decisions to close the coming budget gap won\u2019t be difficult \u2014 particularly if the economic conditions that have slowed the economy continue, or get worse,\" California Department of Finance spokesman H.D. Palmer said.\n\nDespite the gloomy outlook, California is in a better position to weather an economic downturn than it has been in the past. The state has $37.2 billion stored in its various savings accounts. And it has plenty of cash available to meet its obligations this year.\n\n\"It\u2019s not insignificant, but it\u2019s also manageable,\" Legislative Analyst Gabriel Petek said of the deficit. \"We don\u2019t think of this as a budget crisis.\"\n\nCalifornia's revenues are famous for their volatility, peaking and plummeting quickly at the whims of the stock market. Just two years ago, state officials predicted a $54 billion deficit because of the pandemic \u2014 a shortfall that never happened because the economy remained strong.\n\nBut this latest deficit prediction is more likely to stick. Soaring inflation has made everything more expensive. The Federal Reserve has tried to rein in inflation by raising a key interest rate. A higher interest rate makes it more expensive to borrow money, which eventually causes people to spend less. Although that would control price increases, it also cuts demand for goods and services. That leads to layoffs, meaning people pay less in taxes.\n\n\"The chances that the Federal Reserve can tame inflation without inducing a recession are narrow,\" the LAO said in its report.\n\nAlthough employment in California remains strong \u2014 the 3.9% unemployment rate for September is tied for the lowest since 1976 \u2014 the high-wage tech industry has been roiled by a series of recent job cuts. Facebook parent Meta announced last week that it would layoff 11,000 people, or 13% of its workforce.\n\nThe report did not surprise Republicans, who said they have been warning against California's massive increase in public spending for years, with Republican Assembly member Vince Fong calling it \"unsustainable.\"\n\nREPUBLICANS SAY DEMOCRATS WILL \u2018PAY THE PRICE\u2019 IN MIDTERMS FOR PASSING MASSIVE SPENDING BILL\n\n\"Today\u2019s report is another wake-up call to those warnings. We must refocus on fiscal responsibility,\" said Fong, who is vice chair of the Assembly Budget Committee.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Gavin Newsom's administration wasn't surprised, either, calling the $25 billion deficit estimate \"realistic and reasonable.\"\n\n\"The good news is that as we prepare to close a budget shortfall, the state is in its best-ever position to manage a downturn, by having built strong reserves and focusing on one-time commitments,\" said Palmer, the Department of Finance spokesman.\n\nCalifornia lawmakers could conceivably cover all of the deficit with the money it has in its savings accounts, but the Legislative Analyst's Office warned them not to do that. Their outlook predicts deficits not just for this year, but the next three years \u2014 although the size of the deficit decreases each year.\n\nInstead, the Legislative Analyst's Office says lawmakers should delay some of the $75 billion in one-time spending they approved over the past two years. As an example, they pointed to a $500 million program to clean up homeless encampments across the state.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"That's a very good example of the type of pause we had in mind,\" Petek said.\n\nPalmer said the Newsom administration will begin making budget decisions next month. A change in statewide homelessness funding appears to be unlikely, given Newsom's commitment to addressing the issue. Newsom did pause $1 billion in homelessness spending earlier this month, but that decision wasn't related to sinking revenues.\n\nToni Atkins, the Democratic president pro tempore of the California Senate, said she is confident the state can pass a budget this year \"without ongoing cuts to schools and other core programs or taxing middle class families.\"\n\nDemocratic Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon said lawmakers \"can and will protect the progress of recent years' budgets.\"\n\n\"In particular, the Assembly will protect California\u2019s historic school funding gains, as districts must continue to invest in retaining and recruiting staff to help kids advance and recover from the pandemic,\" Rendon said."}, {"title": "Biden knows what he's doing and four other takeaways for this Dem from the midterm elections", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/biden-knows-what-hes-doing-four-other-takeaways-dem-midterm-elections", "tag": "OPINION", "content": "NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n\nThe 2022 midterm election has come and has not yet entirely gone, because as I write this, there are still a dozen House seats up for grabs and votes are still being cured and counted. As a Democrat, I come away from this election with several thoughts; but here are 5 of my takeaways from this latest midterm election cycle.\n\n1. Biden knows what he\u2019s doing\n\nPresident Joe Biden was going to be an albatross around the Democrat\u2019s necks with his 41% favorability rating heading into the midterms and 44% unfavorable in the exit polls; but that just wasn\u2019t the case. Prior to the midterms, every Democratic Senate candidate was polling higher than the president in their home states and individual voters were very much able to differentiate from the president, the party, the candidate and their goals for the future.\n\nThe former senator, vice president and now president, has, as I have always maintained, not governed based on the polls. His \"no malarkey\" style, attacking the MAGA arm of the GOP turned out to be a good and helpful thing for Democrats, and I believe, Biden knew that. The president accurately predicted that the Democratic voters might surprise us, and they did, with this being one of the four best midterms for the party controlling the White House in the last century. This is a man who has had a lifetime of political experience. He knows what he\u2019s doing and people, his party especially, shouldn\u2019t have underestimated him.\n\nSTUDENT LOAN 'BUYOUT,' ABORTION WON MIDTERMS FOR DEMOCRATS, BIDEN, CRITICS SAY\n\n2. The polls (and most pundits) were wrong\n\nPoll after poll and pundit after pundit told a very different story than what happened on Midterm 2022 election night last week. Most pundits based their predictions on those very same polls. The general consensus? Republicans would easily win the House and perhaps the Senate.\n\nWe need to take a good hard look in the mirror with polling and our current polling methodology. Haven\u2019t we learned anything from 2016? When we had those shadow Donald Trump voters who didn\u2019t show up in the polls? That happened again this election cycle whether it be regarding a candidate\u2019s favorability, how many people would turn out to vote for one candidate or party, the issue(s) that matter, etc.\n\nWhat I see (and have since 2016) is our polling system is outdated and isn\u2019t accurate enough for the times we live in and how we live. For example, many people, Gen Z members especially do not have home phones. And even though some people texted you or called you on your cell to obtain the data for their poll/s, that isn\u2019t the majority.\n\nSecond, we have some live people calling and some robo calls; can the latter differentiate between a person who is answering genuinely? And how are the questions posed? We have seen polls back-to-back in a 24-hour period with entirely different results simply based on how the question is phrased.\n\nLastly, some polling outlets have become extremely right- or left leaning; framing the question in a manner that benefits their political bend. Polling should just be number crunching; we need to get back to the basics with a more modern system that keeps up with the times.\n\n3. Inflation wasn\u2019t the only \u2018kitchen table\u2019 issue\n\nSpeaking of the polls, you would think there wasn\u2019t any other issue except for inflation. It was the \u2018kitchen table\u2019 issues that mattered to voters. Polls again got it wrong. It wasn\u2019t just the \u2018economy stupid\u2019 as James Carville said back in 1992, it was also issues like abortion, crime, immigration, etc.\n\nAfter the Supreme Court Dobbs decision overturning Roe v. Wade, I was very skeptical about the numbers (or lack thereof) that I was seeing. After last week\u2019s election, the data was very clear; Abortion did matter. As a matter of fact even though inflation was the most important issue, exit polls show approximately 31% of voters actually said it was most important in weighing in how they voted and who they voted for; and, 27% said abortion weighed heavily into their decision as to which candidate/s they chose, and those voters chose Democrats overwhelmingly for both the House and the Senate.\n\nDemocracy was also a big issue and certainly on the ballot. You don\u2019t need exit polls to show you that; just look at the rejection by voters of election deniers who ran for governor, secretary or State, House and Senate. There were seven election deniers who ran for governor in various states; none of them won.\n\n4. There was no \u2018Red Wave\u2019\n\nSo, let\u2019s look back at the polls and the pundits and their predictions, and you would hear things like: \"Democratic bloodbath,\" \"Red tsunami,\" and of course the big \"Red Wave.\" Well, even top Republicans like Senator Lindsey Graham agree there was no Red Wave; there wasn\u2019t even a Red Ripple, I call it more of a Red Drip.\n\nAnd this was because candidates, parties, polls and pundits weren\u2019t actually listening to the voters. Not to toot my own horn here, but I did predict that the House would probably end up in Republican hands but by a much smaller margin than was being predicted, I also predicted that Democrats would keep the Senate and that abortion would be a much bigger issue especially among women.\n\nI don\u2019t have some magic crystal ball others don\u2019t, but I knew that different states and different districts had different issues that mattered to them. In the state of Colorado for instance, abortion actually was higher than inflation among voter\u2019s top issues. So, you can\u2019t just use a headline like \u2018inflation is up,\u2019 or \u2018Joe Biden\u2019s approval rating is down\u2019 to measure how someone will vote and what really matters to them.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThe lack of a red wave is not only an embarrassment to the GOP and to their leadership especially to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy who already had 36 votes against him becoming the next speaker if the Republicans do in fact take the House; but it also shows that putting forth extreme candidates is never a good idea.\n\n5. Generation Z made the difference\n\nIn midterm elections, Republicans typically show up in numbers much stronger and larger than Democrats. But that was not the case in this election. For those expecting a red wave, they weren\u2019t expecting the blue earthquake Gen Z voters created that helped put up a blue wall against that red wave.\n\nIn 2018, Gen Z turned out in record numbers to vote and this time, in 2022, they did it again; but this time, they voted for Democratic candidates over Republicans by 25 percentage points. These are voters under 29 years of age. This voting block cared greatly about student loans, climate change and very, very much about reproductive rights. They also liked candidates who were speaking their language and speaking to them where they live; on social media: Twitter, Facebook, TikTok, etc. Senator-elect John Fetterman of Pennsylvania had an incredible social media outreach to voters, and it paid off; Gen Z voted for him by a margin of 46% points.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPrior to the midterm election people asked me if I was scared that my party would get demolished in the election or that Trump\u2019s candidates and the MAGA faction of the Republican Party would rise to power (again) and attempt to thwart Democracy and to be honest, I wasn\u2019t worried; I have faith in my country and in the American people. They didn\u2019t let me or this nation down last week and judging from the new young voters coming up; the future is looking very bright and, dare I say, very blue."}, {"title": "Washington Post mocked for mourning FTX founder now can't stop another pandemic: 'Dumbest take imaginable'", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/media/washington-post-mocked-mourning-ftx-founder-stop-another-pandemic-dumbest-take", "tag": "MEDIA", "content": "The Washington Post was ridiculed on Twitter over a piece lamenting the fall of cryptocurrency FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, and the collapse of his plans to stop a second pandemic.\n\n\"FTX collapse dooms founder\u2019s effort to prevent another pandemic, @ddiamondreports,\" Washington Post Deputy National Editor Philip Rucker tweeted, alongside a link to the article.\n\nAt its peak FTX was the third-largest cryptocurrency exchange, but it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protections on Friday, and the company confirmed over the weekend that millions of dollars worth of assets are unaccounted for.

Marco Rubio and Cindy Hyde-Smith was originally published on March 20, 2020.\n\nThis Sunday, 97 percent of Americans will be forced to change their clocks once again, \"springing forward\" an hour into daylight saving time (DST). The process of having to reset our clocks is an irritatingly outdated practice that we should ditch. We should instead embrace DST as a critically important way to realign daylight time to Americans\u2019 most productive hours, while also improving public health and the American economy.\n\nThankfully, we have a solution. Our \"Sunshine Protection Act\" would shift the United States to permanent DST year-round, eliminating the need to worry about changing clocks in November and March. The bill, which has 12 bipartisan cosponsors, awaits action before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, which has authority over the Uniform Time Act.\n\nStandardizing DST wouldn\u2019t entail some massive change, nor would it overturn some profound legacy in American history. Originally conceived in 1916 as a wartime effort to conserve fuel in Germany, daylight saving time actually has a varied history in our nation. It only lasted half the year for most of its implementation until 2005, when it was extended to the current eight months. Yes, we endure the hassle of changing our clocks to spend 16 weeks \u2013 33 percent of the year \u2013 on Standard Time.\n\nHOW DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME AFFECTS HEALTH\n\nResearch sheds light on the significant health benefits of extending DST for the entire year. By recalibrating the portion of the day spent in sunlight to standard work hours, studies suggest that we would see advantages to Americans\u2019 public health, including reduced risks of seasonal depression, cardiac problems and strokes. Children exercise more during DST, and adults spend substantially more time engaged in pedestrian, cycling and other recreational activities.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nSimilarly, year-round DST would boost public safety. A Brookings study suggests it would bring a 27 percent reduction in robberies committed during the evening hour of gained sunlight, with the overall daily rate dropping by 7 percent. Another group of researchers found permanent DST could also result in fewer car accidents, reducing the rate of vehicle collisions with wildlife as traffic patterns shift an hour away from nocturnal animal behavior.\n\nExtending DST to last the entire year would also spur the economy. A JP Morgan Chase study found that Americans experience decreased economic activity while not on DST, a drop that could be avoided by making daylight saving permanent. It would also benefit our nation\u2019s agricultural sector, which ends up disproportionately affected twice a year through disruptions between farmers\u2019 schedules and their supply chain partners. Several studies also suggest that it would lead to greater energy savings.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOur bill isn\u2019t radical. Despite the significant economic and health benefits, the Sunshine Protection Act doesn\u2019t alter time zones, change the total number of hours of sunlight per day, or mandate that states and territories that do not observe DST suddenly be forced to join. Instead, it represents a commonsense solution \u2013 one supported by states as varied as Maine, Florida, California, Tennessee, South Carolina, Delaware, Oregon and Washington, and under consideration by dozens more, including Mississippi.\n\nInconveniencing hundreds of millions of Americans to continue changing our clocks for 16 dark weeks is antiquated and outdated. With such clear advantages to year-round DST, Congress has no excuse to remain in the dark on the issue. Join us, and help #LocktheClock.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY SEN.

Moreover, teachers, police and other public servants say they cannot afford to live in the places where they work, resulting in nightmare commutes and staffing shortages.\n\nBackers say rent control policies are needed to curb sharp increases that put tenants at risk of eviction. They say protections are especially needed now as more corporations snap up rental housing for profit.

Congressional Democrats who want to repeal it to give themselves a permanent blank check to spend American taxpayer dollars are equal parts smug elites and constitutional vandals.\n\nCongressional Republicans should absolutely fight to defend the statutory debt limit this year and leverage it next year to extract badly needed spending reforms from President Joe Biden and his party.\n\nThat the sentences above are considered uncouth inside the Beltway is not evidence of Washington elites\u2019 supple political sophistication, but of their chronic political disconnect from the nation they serve.\n\nRICK SCOTT ANNOUNCES PLAN TO UNSEAT MITCH MCCONNELL AS THE TOP REPUBLICAN IN THE SENATE\n\nContrary to the phony narrative coming soon to an editorial page near you, the debt ceiling is not a formality. It is not an anachronism or a symbol. It is an indispensable tool, specifically designed to protect taxpayers and check the ambitions of entitled politicians. The contempt elites in both parties have for the debt ceiling is compelling evidence for its value.\n\nBy the same logic, lawmakers who demand spending fixes in exchange for raising the debt limit are not threatening the full faith and credit of the United States \u2014 they are protecting it, by using the tool exactly as it was designed.\n\nTo listen to media and liberal elites, federal spending growth is a kind of sacrament, and anything that checks it sullies its holy purity.\n\nHogwash.\n\nThe Constitution and federal law are thick with restrictions on government\u2019s ability to spend your money. The Origination Clause. The Spending Clause. Appropriations time limits. Since our founding, Americans have always known that politicians cannot be trusted with a blank check with your name on it.\n\nThis timeless truth takes on new urgency today, as federal overspending triggered America\u2019s worst inflation crisis in 40 years, and a new recession. For the first time in a generation, wages are not keeping up with prices. The costs of gasoline, food, and housing have exploded as Biden and congressional Democrats drowned the economy in almost $5 trillion in additional deficit spending in less than two years.\n\nAnd with the Federal Reserve having \"bought\" nearly all of the debt from Congress\u2019s new spending \u2014 that is, just printed more money like someone cheating at \"Monopoly\" \u2014 Biden\u2019s only fiscal plan is \u2026 more spending!\n\nMeanwhile, this administration continues to mindlessly block domestic energy production, refuses to end COVID-19 spending despite the end of the pandemic, and wants to pour gasoline on the fire with an illegal student loan \"forgiveness\" plan. They watch from the sidelines as China gears up for a new Cold War \u2013 one in which we cannot prevail by stealing from our citizens to rack up credit card debt we never intend to pay off.\n\nMoments like this \u2014 when the political class\u2019s fiscal irresponsibility strangles our economy and threatens our national security \u2014 are why we have tools like the debt limit in the first place. In this environment, of course congressional Republicans should deny Biden an unconditional increase in the debt ceiling. To not lean into this fight \u2014 especially following a landslide electoral rebuke to the drunken sailors running Washington today \u2014 would be a dereliction of duty and political malpractice.\n\nMoreover, the Biden administration is defending dysfunctional policies on so many fronts that conservatives can take their pick of any popular, meaningful reforms to demand in exchange for raising the debt ceiling, starting with a cap on government spending and putting the budget on a sustainable path.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nAny Republican concerned about their embarrassing inability to parry the media\u2019s narrative about partisan brinksmanship can simply insist that any debt limit bill be considered via an open amendment process on the House and Senate floors.

That\u2019s why both party establishments dislike them \u2014 and why a new generation of conservative leaders should relish one.\n\nFor two hard years, Washington elites have ignored fiscal \u2014 to say nothing of legal and constitutional \u2014 constraints on their ideological ambitions.

They have seemingly retaken the House of Representatives, picking up around ten seats, ushering in divided government. The House GOP offers a welcome bulwark against destructive leftist policies.\n\nThat means the end of Democrats' reckless spending that's fueling the inflationary fire burning holes in Americans' pockets. It means tax increases, radical labor law rewrites, and other destructive far-left legislative proposals are off the table. Small business owners are breathing a sigh of relief.\n\nRepublicans also still have a path to retaking the Senate. If Nevada Republican Senate candidate Adam Laxalt can maintain his lead, Senate control will be determined (as in 2020) by the Georgia runoff election in December.\n\nJOHN TILLMAN: FOUR WAYS REPUBLICANS CAN BEGIN TO TURN OUR COUNTRY AROUND BY 2024\n\nIf the GOP can thread this Senate needle, it can also offer a check against the confirmation of Biden's activist judges who would rubber-stamp his executive overreach. This control is especially important as Biden will increasingly resort to executive orders over the next two years to try to implement his agenda in the face of a divided government.\n\nRepublicans' performance on Election Day was a victory for small businesses, the economy, and the country. Voters made their voices heard that they want an end to progressive control of the government. Yet it's also a disappointment that no red wave materialized to more fully repudiate Biden and Congressional Democrats' failures over the last two years.\n\nPart of the reason for Republicans' relatively few House pickups (at least by historical midterm standards) is prosaic: The GOP got a head start in 2020 when it gained 14 House seats. Those wins, combined with this cycle's, make the overall performance more impressive.\n\nAs I predicted, Republicans narrowed Democrats' lead among Hispanics \u2013 but not by enough. The GOP must continue targeting this growing demographic of (in the words of Ronald Reagan) Republicans who don't know it yet to eliminate the remaining Hispanic partisan gap.\n\nDemocrats also ran up the score among white female college graduates and non-married women, whom they won by 14 and 37 points, respectively, according to exit polls. The Democrats' shameful demagoguery of abortion clearly had an impact. So did their dirty primary tricks elevating Republican candidates unpopular with this demographic.\n\nPerhaps the biggest bright spot for Republicans this election was the resounding victories from governors who successfully managed a once-in-a-century pandemic and a challenging economic environment. For instance, Govs. Brian Kemp (GA) and Ron DeSantis (FL) dramatically outperformed their 2018 totals and other Republicans despite coming under withering scrutiny over their Covid-19 response. Govs. Kim Reynolds (IA) and Kristi Noem (SD) also had big nights.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nVoters rewarded these governors for resisting pressure from the Biden administration, media, and various \"experts\" to close their economies and put onerous restrictions on small businesses. They kept their economies open and empowered their small businesses with sound policies to allow them to flourish despite historic challenges. And they have been vindicated for it.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nConfidently standing up for free markets and fighting back against woke culture as these governors have done is a recipe to break through the country's partisan balkanization. These state laboratories of democracy, which Job Creators Network has been highlighting as part of its Great Opportunity Project, reveal the best path forward to jumpstart the national economy and provide a template for other pro-small business policymakers and candidates to follow.\n\nThe first step in a national economic turnaround is stopping the bad policy from Washington. Republicans accomplished this on Election Day. The next step is building momentum by copying victorious GOP governors.

He said the law written by Congress does hold that in some cases vessels must pay the salaries of environmental observers on board, but he said that requirement is not specifically called for in the case of the New Jersey fishermen.\n\nNonetheless, NOAA has broadened that requirement beyond the limited scope agreed to by Congress, and courts have cited Chevron as a basis for keeping the rule in place. Clement said it's time for the Supreme Court to consider overruling Chevron or at least temper the precedent that it set decades ago.\n\n\"It is the duty of the judiciary to step in when any branch of government has abused its power,\" Clement said. \"This case is about correcting one such abuse and reining in executive overreach that threatens the livelihoods of fishing families and the constitutional balance of power.\"\n\nThe application of the Chevron deference has been challenged by several members of the Supreme Court.

That kind of judicial abdication disserves both our veterans and the law.\"\n\nJustice Samuel Alito and Chief Justice John Roberts criticized the way the Chevron deference is applied in a 2013 decision about the Federal Communications Commission.

It did Tuesday when voters once again rejected the party in power, although not by the margins that some prognosticators anticipated.\n\nRepudiation victories have become one of the most distinctive patterns in modern American politics. Understandably, Republicans expected to be celebrating sweeping victories this go around.\n\nEven though they\u2019re not, it doesn\u2019t mean voters validated the policies or governing savvy of the left. The question now is will the GOP learn the lessons of the midterm and turn things around in 2024?\n\nBased on my experience having founded and led numerous organizations on the right, the first step to achieving any measure of political or policy success is to actually listen to the people you\u2019re trying to help.\n\nIn the week leading up to the election, polls showed that Americans were concerned about pocketbook issues, especially record inflation. This cut across every demographic, including the coveted suburban female vote. Talk to people at any gas station or grocery store across the country, and they\u2019ll share how they\u2019re pre-paying $5, $10 or $15 at the pump because that\u2019s all they can afford. They\u2019re cutting corners on groceries so they can pay rent.\n\nAmericans are also concerned about what\u2019s happening in their neighborhoods and schools. Violence and lawlessness have spread into every facet of society, yet the left has underfunded and demoralized police forces. Catastrophic learning loss and widespread mental health issues have been the result of unnecessary school lockdowns, yet teachers\u2019 unions and school bureaucracies are focusing on transgender ideology and critical race theory.\n\nMore subtly, Americans are rejecting identity politics. To most, diversity still means people from all backgrounds coming together in the American melting pot. The left has instead transformed diversity into separation, division, and resentment. That is not how citizens see themselves or how they live. According to the 2020 US census, most white people live in mixed-race neighborhoods for the first time in modern history. In their daily lives, people from all backgrounds get along and want unity and belief in a shared American Dream.\n\nGiven these factors, Republicans missed a big opportunity to gain seats. Much has been made about the Trump effect. But the bottom line is too many candidates lacked the seriousness to show they can solve problems and knit our social fabric back together.\n\nSo, what should the right do the next two years?\n\nThe first step they must take is to develop a concrete economic agenda that promotes growth and overall prosperity. Reining in out-of-control spending that has driven inflation to a 40-year high and the national debt to over 133 percent of the economy is a start. Self-imposed spending caps will immediately reduce deficits. Explaining the consequences of astronomical debt to younger Americans and their children, who now have an interest burden approaching $1 billion a year, is essential.\n\nSecond, also tied to the economy, is to adopt a sustainable energy policy that lowers gas prices. Tapping into domestic energy sources creates good paying jobs, lowers energy costs, and reduces U.S. reliance on bad actors. Republicans must unleash every energy source available at home while also encouraging research and development to make energy cleaner. It does not have to be one or the other.\n\nA third area of opportunity is to stop the administrative state\u2019s overreach. This will return more power to the people, by freeing them from unnecessary, often politically motivated rules and regulations that make it harder to start a small business, run a school or save and invest hard-earned money. Further, it encourages problem-solving at the local level, which is where issues like education and crime should be addressed.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nFinally, Republicans must lead on immigration. Securing the border, while providing an orderly, controlled process for entry into the country can be done simultaneously. Further, a Latino comes of voting age every 30 seconds. The right must remind these young voters that their values \u2013 faith, family, and hard work \u2013 are reflected in the party that offers the best pathway to achieving the American dream.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nConsider the big GOP wins Tuesday \u2013 Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, both of whom have boldly tackled immigration while also gaining the trust and support of Hispanic constituents.\n\nRepublicans must offer a positive vision and deliver on an agenda that people want.

While there was no red tsunami, Republicans made gains and, thankfully, we will likely have a divided government for the remainder of the Biden presidency.\n\nSo, what does that mean for working- and middle-class Americans? What can Republicans do to turn the economy around with only one \u2013 perhaps two \u2013 houses of Congress? As it turns out, they can do quite a lot. Let\u2019s look at what might play out economically under each of the likely post-election scenarios.\n\nFirst, with a majority in at least the House, Republicans can put an end to the Democrats\u2019 passing the massive spending spree legislation that has been driving inflation and crushing American families (such as the bloated American Rescue Plan and the ironically named Inflation Reduction Act). That alone will do wonders for the business community, as it will eliminate the current uncertainty about what horribly misguided legislation Democrats will pass next.\n\nMIDTERM ELECTIONS 2022: LIVE UPDATES\n\nShould Republicans win both the House and Senate, they could use the reconciliation process (which avoids the filibuster and allows the Senate to pass fiscal legislation on just a majority vote) to pass pro-growth legislation. Biden would then be forced to either veto the legislation (as Clinton did with the Republican-passed tax cuts in 1995) or sign it into law (as Clinton did with welfare reform).\n\nIf that is ultimately the case, I would expect Republicans to focus on energy and crime. Energy is both a jobs and anti-inflation issue, with substantial national security overtones.\n\nCHOOSING BETWEEN FOOD AND FUEL LEAVES MORE AMERICANS OUT IN THE COLD\n\nGiven Tuesday night\u2019s election results and the genuine crises facing our nation, there are likely Senate Democrats who would support measures in both areas \u2013 maybe not enough to defeat a filibuster, but enough to make those issues genuinely bipartisan. That is the kind of bipartisanship Americans have been hoping for. This is an opportunity for both political parties to deliver.\n\nEven with control of just the House, Republicans can also start turning the tide on excessive government spending and inflation. Inflation and the economy consistently polled as the No. 1 issue on the minds of voters and were a deciding factor in a number of otherwise close races. Two ways House Republicans can address excessive spending are:\n\nGovernment Funding: By tradition, general appropriation bills originate in the House and appropriations is where most policy fights will happen over the next two years.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nIt is also where Republicans will have maximum leverage \u2013 Biden\u2019s government needs taxpayers\u2019 money in order to do anything. Republicans should rein in spending levels and also cut off harmful spending that funds the left\u2019s agenda. Cutting back on funding for some of Biden\u2019s spending and tax giveaways to green energy programs would be a great place to start.\n\nDebt Limit: The Treasury will hit the $31.2 trillion debt limit next year. That is an absurd amount of debt, particularly with interest rates rising. Increasing the debt limit has historically served as a leverage point for doing something about spending, going back 40 years.\n\nAny agreement on a debt limit increase should be paired with spending cuts and reforms that address our nation\u2019s underlying problem \u2013 unsustainable spending.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAll of this points to a better, stronger economy with Republicans in control of one or both houses of Congress.\n\nElections matter because policy matters \u2013 and, as the last 21 months demonstrate, it matters a lot.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM ANDY PUZDER"}, {"title": "A mom's midterm election view from the kitchen table: Democrats are poised to fail and here's why", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/moms-midterms-election-view-kitchen-table-democrats-poised-fail", "tag": "OPINION", "content": "NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n\nUnder the Democrats\u2019 reign, the last two years have been plagued by gross overreach in our schools, crippling inflation and surging violent crime in cities run by the left.\n\nNow the party that pledged allegiance to Joe Biden, shut down your kids\u2019 schools, depleted your bank account and made it more dangerous to walk outside wants you to reelect them.

The White House would own this too.\n\nBy way of background, the Biden administration took a victory lap after it helped broker an agreement between freight railroads and their labor unions to avert a strike.

And in mobile home parks, the state's last bastions of affordability, out-of-state investors are buying the land and hiking up lease prices.\n\nFed-up Coloradans have taken the crisis into their own hands and will vote Tuesday on a host of local and statewide ballot measures intended to rein in the soaring cost of housing.\n\nThe U.S. Census Bureau found that over half of all Colorado tenants are considered rent burdened, spending more than 30% of their income on rent in 2020. Colorado housing prices rank among the nation's highest when accounting for how much its residents earn.

It's the only statewide affordable housing measure in the country that will be decided in Tuesday's midterm election.\n\nVoters in at least 13 Colorado communities or counties are considering measures that would increase taxes on short-term rentals such as those booked through Airbnb and Vrbo or redirect existing taxes on them to help toward housing costs, at least partly.\n\nIn Colorado's largest city, Denver, residents are considering levying a fee on most landlords that would bankroll attorneys for tenants facing eviction, which would expand free representation that lower-income renters can already receive.\n\nThe housing referendums arrive as the last dregs of pandemic-era rental assistance that acted as a bulwark against eviction for tens of thousands of Coloradans disappear.\n\n\"People are struggling with dire need and the immediacy of displacement, of gentrification, of the high cost of living,\" said Zach Neumann, executive director of Colorado's COVID-19 Eviction Defense Project, which has endorsed the statewide ballot measure. \"They are saying: \u2018What can I do right now in my community to address the real consequences of that?\u2019\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Edna W.

Adam Burg, the chamber's vice president of government affairs, argued that the existing protections for low- and moderate-income tenants, along with nonprofits offering legal council, are enough.\n\nWest of Denver, between the crags of the Rocky Mountains, at least 13 communities or counties have ballot measures that would increase taxes on short-term rentals or redirect existing taxes on them to, in part, help toward housing costs.\n\nWhen asked about the measures, Tom Martinelli, Airbnb's senior public policy manager, said, \"experts agree the affordable housing issue in communities across the U.S. can be boiled down to simply not building enough affordable housing.\"\n\nMartinelli added that Airbnb supports Colorado's statewide housing ballot measure.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe sweeping movement to raise taxes on short-term rentals seeks to counter dramatic shifts in the housing market brought on partly by the pandemic's remote-work revolution.

Faced with a critically undersized police force over the summer, the city purchased two condominiums for $1 million each in order to entice two more officers to join the force, she said.\n\nIn response to the crisis, the City Council added a ballot initiative that would raise taxes by 5% to 10% on short-term rentals based on whether the units are owner-occupied. Slightly more than two-thirds of that revenue would go toward affordable housing projects in the community.\n\n\"You have to participate in your own rescue,\" said Richards.\n\nBen Wolff, general manager of Frias Properties of Aspen, a company that manages short-term rentals, worries that a hike in taxes would impede the resort city's ability to lure vacationers.

Iran is back in the headlines, prices at the gas pump are causing sticker shock, and inflation is at the top of everyone\u2019s minds. The last time inflation was this high was shortly after President Jimmy Carter left office, voted out by Americans fed up with seeing the value of their paychecks shrink every month.\n\n\n\nJoe Biden\u2019s presidency has frequently been compared to the malaise of the Carter era.

Today, America is overwhelmed by the crises created by President Biden and Washington Democrats\u2013 record inflation, unchecked violent crime, high gas prices, record illegal crossings at the southern border, and the list goes on.\n\n\n\nDespite these comparisons, the truth is Joe Biden is giving Carter a run for this money when it comes to delivering the worst inflation crisis in living memory.\n\nReckless spending by President Biden and Washington Democrats ignited and then has thrown more fuel on the inflation fire, where now inflation has grown over twice as fast as it did under Carter. To put matters in perspective, inflation is now 500 percent higher than it was when Biden took office. Even at its peak, inflation under Carter had only grown by 200 percent compared to when he took office.\n\nCNN HOST JOKES AMERICANS WILL HAVE TO EAT SMALLER PORTIONS THIS THANKSGIVING DUE TO INFLATION\n\nThe comparison between Biden and Carter gets worse still if inflation were measured the same way it was when Carter was president. Beginning in the 80\u2019s, the federal government has gradually but significantly changed its method of calculating inflation, notably by excluding housing prices and changing the relative weights on various goods as people buy less of what they can no longer afford due to inflation. This new measure fails to capture the full impact inflation is having on families. For example, it completely ignores the fact that the average mortgage payment on new homes has increased by 50 percent since last year. If we were to use the Carter-era measure, Biden\u2019s inflation crisis is even worse. Inflation today would be around 16.4 percent, not 8.2 percent and total inflation since Biden became president would be 29.7 percent, according to estimates from economist John Williams.\n\nPresident Biden thought he could avoid comparisons to the Carter Presidency if he just ignored the inflationary warnings signs that were obvious to any American who stepped foot in a grocery store. Instead, Biden has chosen to blame a new villain every month for his failures \u2013 COVID, supply chains, greedy businesses, and even Vladimir Putin. At the same time his administration was burying its collective heads in the sand, it was also pushing through trillions in new spending that made things even worse. As Biden\u2019s excuses kept piling up, prices continued to skyrocket, and Americans were stuck paying the price.\n\nPresident Biden has set records for the biggest increase in spending and debt in a president\u2019s first 20 months in office. Under one-party rule, the Democrats in control of government have increased spending by $10 trillion more than projected when Biden took office.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nCarter\u2019s inflation malaise forced the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates and America\u2019s economy fell into a recession, just as the Federal Reserve is having to do today \u2013 and it has begun to take its toll.

Families in our state and across the nation are being crushed by the rising cost of living caused by the president\u2019s reckless trillion-dollar spending sprees and war on American energy.\n\nIn Maryland, we\u2019ve taken the complete opposite approach. We turned our economy around from 49th to number six in the nation by cutting taxes for eight years in a row by $4.7 billion and restoring fiscal responsibility, turning a $5.1 billion budget deficit into a record $5.5 billion surplus.\n\nCLOSING ARGUMENTS: REPUBLICANS, DEMOCRATS MAKE THEIR CASE TO AMERICANS AHEAD OF MIDTERM ELECTIONS\n\nSecond, the far-left demonization of our police and weak-on-violent-crime policies are wreaking havoc. This is a major reason why even blue states like Oregon and New York have competitive governors\u2019 races. Meanwhile, Marylanders, regardless of their party affiliation, overwhelmingly support our Re-fund the Police initiative, which is providing half-a-billion dollars of additional funding to state and local law enforcement agencies, and our proposals to get tough on violent criminals.\n\nThird, we\u2019re fed up with wokeism that is dangerously dividing our country by aiming to separate Americans into groups of grievance-driven victims and turning every policy disagreement into a culture war battle where there is no room for compromise.\n\nIn 2018, we debunked this dangerous far-left identity politics that says the way you think or the way you vote is pre-determined by the color of your skin, where you live, where you were born, or where you worship by winning women, Hispanics, Asians and historic levels of the Black vote. This year, across the country, the most diverse slate of Republican candidates in history is debunking that narrative as well.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nRather than address any of these real concerns of everyday Americans, President Biden has tried to change the subject, framing the midterm as a battle for democracy itself. But here the president\u2019s deeds don\u2019t match his high-minded rhetoric.\n\nThe president warns about election denialism but supports the original election denier Stacey Abrams in Georgia and remains mum on the unprecedented effort from his party to spend tens of millions of dollars to help nominate many of those same Republican candidates he calls threats, including here in Maryland. He conflates social conservatism with authoritarianism by attacking the tens of millions of Americans who disagree with him as a threat to democracy.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMarylanders and Americans are rightly deeply concerned about the rise of toxic politics, rabid tribalism and a loss of trust in our institutions.

Joe Biden assumed the presidency with no mandate; in fact, Democrats lost 14 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. The American people made it clear that Biden was in office not to upend the successful Trump agenda, but to unite our country and compromise with Republicans in a narrowly divided Congress.\n\nBut that\u2019s not what happened.\n\nEntrenched career politicians Joe Biden, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., immediately reverted to old form by ignoring the will of the American people. These Democrat fossils could never come to grips with the fact that America is a center-right country.\n\nAmericans favor liberty, low taxes and limited government; they stand with our heroic police and for law and order; they support legal immigration and public schools that teach children to love their country; and they want a competent foreign policy guided by a peace through strength approach.

As we were coming out of the pandemic, Biden and congressional Democrats abused power and overheated the system with trillions upon trillions in irresponsible federal spending instead of allowing the economy to rebound naturally. Now Americans are struggling to make ends meet due to the high cost of gas, food and every other staples that families need to survive.\n\nBut these reckless Democrats didn\u2019t stop after creating the inflation crisis. They unilaterally opened our southern border and caused a fentanyl, human trafficking and humanitarian crisis while falsely insisting that the border is secure.\n\nAdditionally, by fanning the flames of the defund police movement and pushing for a cashless bail system, Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and other liberals paved the way for a spike in crime that has Americans feeling unsafe in their own neighborhoods. In response, some leftist politicians are calling the crime that everyone sees on their television screens every night a conspiracy theory.\n\nTo make matters worse, if these radical Democrats had their way on education, they would allow critical race theory to destroy our schools and boys would be free to compete in girls\u2019 sports and use their restrooms.\n\nThese unhinged Democrats have made it abundantly clear why we need a system of checks and balances.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nEvery two years, voters get to decide if our country needs a course correction and polls are indicating that the American people are preparing to reject the disaster that total Democrat control has caused.

The collective amount owed has doubled from the end of 2019 to now. Families struggling to put food on the table may not find those mean tweets quite so distasteful now as they wistfully recall the Trump-era policies that saved the average family of four $2,500 a year.\n\nBut why are American families facing this energy-driven inflationary spiral? Well, prices have surged because President Joe Biden\u2019s policies essentially guaranteed they would surge. When there is a shortage of a product in demand, the price of that product increases. Fossil fuels are clearly in high demand and limiting the supply of such fuels obviously increased the costs.\n\nTRUCKING, OIL COMPANIES RAMP UP WARNINGS ON DIESEL SHORTAGE: 'WE PUT OURSELVES IN THIS SITUATION'\n\nBiden made his devastatingly bad policies on oil production crystal clear from the beginning of his run for the presidency. Recall that during the 2020 campaign, Biden told a young supporter \"look in my eyes\" as he said, \"I guarantee you we\u2019re going to end fossil fuels.\" That statement wasn\u2019t one of the all-too-common Biden gaffs. In a February 2020 rally he stated very clearly from prepared remarks, \"We are going to get rid of fossil fuels.\"\n\nAnd there you have it.\n\nToday, tight diesel and natural gas supplies threaten to exacerbate already sky-high inflation and supply chain issues, devastating American families. According to data the Department of Energy released last week, our diesel supply (essential for supply chain transportation) is down to 25 days, the lowest level on record going back to 1993. For people in the Northeast, who depend on diesel to heat their homes in the winter (like Sherri Bukovskey), supplies have dropped to a third of their typical levels for this time of year.\n\nThe situation is critical. To address the existing and pending crises Biden\u2019s anti-fossil fuel policies have caused, it seems obvious that the president should unequivocally admit the error of his ways and tell American bankers, asset managers, administration officials, and environmentalists to get out of the way because America needs more oil now!\n\nThat apparently is not as obvious as it sounds.\n\nOn Monday, the president \u2014 who guaranteed he would get rid of fossil fuels \u2014 demanded that fossil fuel companies increase production. Seriously. He attacked oil companies for taking \"windfall of war\" profits, demanded that they increase their production and threatened them with a \"higher tax\" on their excess profits if they fail to invest in increased production.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nIt boggles the mind. In what economic universe do you encourage investment with the threat of higher taxes on an industry you have already committed to destroy? For some inexplicable reason, Biden remains committed to his \"whole-of-government approach\" in attacking the oil and gas industry \u2014 seemingly oblivious that his policies are causing the problem. To the extent oil industry profits are a windfall of a war, it\u2019s the Biden administration\u2019s war with fossil fuel producers \u2013 which was driving energy prices higher well before Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine. Even Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has admitted that Biden\u2019s \"Putin Price Hike\" claim is simply untrue.\n\nThreatening oil companies is not how you get them to invest. Just a couple of years ago, during nationwide forced lockdowns, these same companies had record losses. Now they\u2019re using some of those profits to pay off debts, and, if Biden stops his anti-fossil fuel onslaught, they will eventually use that money to increase production. But why would any business invest in new infrastructure if the government is simply going to regulate it out of existence?\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAnd speaking of profits from increased oil prices, when Biden releases oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, he does exactly what oil companies do \u2014 he sells it in the open market in a \"price competitive sale.\" The government doesn\u2019t give its oil away for free, and it doesn\u2019t sell it at cost. It sells at the market rate \u2014 just like the oil companies. Biden is criticizing oil companies for taking \"a windfall of war\" profit, while he sells oil at the same price, taking the same profits, and claiming credit for any reduction in the federal deficit. Some might call that hypocritical. Others might be more direct.\n\nIn reality, access to affordable, reliable energy has reduced poverty and improved human lives dramatically for two centuries. Few industries have truly invested in America like oil and gas. Biden\u2019s policies are an irrational threat to that prosperity.

During this political season it is easy to blame President Joe Biden and Democrats for inflation. But that\u2019s just not accurate.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear. Inflation is not unique to America. It is an international crisis. In the European Union, inflation is nearly 11%. In Germany, it is 11.6%. In the United Kingdom it is 10.1%. In Ireland, it\u2019s 9.6%. In America, it\u2019s 8.2%, much too high, but lower than it is throughout much of Europe.\n\nThe truth is that inflation is, to a significant extent, caused by the ongoing global pandemic, the break in international supply chains and the horrific war in Ukraine. But there is another major reason for inflation that too few people talk about. And that is the unprecedented level of corporate greed that we are now seeing.\n\nAccording to a recent study, nearly 54% of the rise in inflation is directly attributable to the astronomical increase in corporate profit margins. In America today, while the working class struggles to put food on the table, fill up their gas tanks and heat their homes, corporate profits are at a 70-year-high.\n\nIf you want to know why you are paying $4, $5, $6 for a gallon of gas, you should know that the profits of ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP and Shell skyrocketed by 169% so far this year to $125 billion. These four huge oil companies are spending over $73 billion not to reduce gas prices at the pump but to buy back their own stock and increase dividends to their wealthy stockholders.\n\nIf you are wondering why you are paying 43% more for an airline ticket this year, you should know that profits are up 186% at American Airlines and 99% at United Airlines in the third quarter to nearly $1.5 billion. Yes. These are the same companies that received taxpayer assistance of more than $20 billion during the pandemic while cutting 6,400 jobs.\n\nIf you are wondering why global food prices skyrocketed by over 33% last year and are expected to go up another 23% this year, you should know that billionaires in the global food and agri-business industry became $382 billion richer during the pandemic.\n\nIf you are wondering why we continue to pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, you should know that Pfizer has increased its profits by 42% so far this year to $26.4 billion.\n\nI apologize to no one that we expanded the Child Tax Credit that provided $300 a month per child to working families so that parents could raise their kids with a modicum of security.\n\nEven though inflation is an international problem, my Republican colleagues want to blame rising prices on Democratic spending \u2013 especially the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan passed in March 2021. Well, before you accept that argument, I urge you to remember where we were at that terrible and painful moment in American history.\n\nAs the worst pandemic in modern history raged across the country, over 3,000 Americans were dying from COVID-19 every single day and millions, including many with inadequate health insurance, were getting sick. Doctors and nurses lacked adequate personal protective equipment and many hospitals, flooded with COVID-19 patients, were on the verge of collapse.\n\nFurther, as a result of the pandemic, in early 2021 the United States was suffering its worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. Twenty-four million Americans were unemployed, under-employed or had given up looking for work. Hunger in America was at its highest level in decades. Millions of Americans were in danger of being evicted from their homes. Hundreds of thousands of small businesses all over the country were on the verge of going bankrupt.\n\nAs the chairman of the Budget Committee, I apologize to no one for helping to pass this bill in the Senate \u2013 without one Republican vote. At a time of an unprecedented health and economic crisis caused by the pandemic, the American Rescue Plan did exactly what a democratic government in a civilized society is supposed to do: respond to the needs of people living in fear and desperation.\n\nI apologize to no one that we provided every working class American and their children with a $1,400 direct payment to get them through the economic crisis they were experiencing.\n\nI apologize to no one that we extended unemployment benefits and provided an extra $300 a week to Americans who had lost their jobs.\n\nI apologize to no one that we expanded the Child Tax Credit that provided $300 a month per child to working families so that parents could raise their kids with a modicum of security.\n\nI apologize to no one that we prevented hospitals from closing their doors during the pandemic, fed the hungry, prevented evictions and foreclosures and made sure every American could receive a COVID-19 vaccine for free.\n\nWhile Republicans continue to criticize the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan that helped struggling working class families in a time of economic desperation, it is fair to ask what they are proposing to do if they gain control over the House and the Senate? And here\u2019s the answer.\n\nAlmost all of them, from Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell on down, want to provide billionaires a tax break worth up to $1.75 trillion by completely repealing the estate tax.\n\nThe estate tax only applies to the wealthiest of the wealthy, the top one-tenth of one percent of American families who inherit over $25 million. In other words, 99.9% of Americans would not benefit at all from the repeal of the estate tax.\n\nIf the estate tax was repealed, Elon Musk\u2019s family would receive a tax break of up to $80 billion alone. Now, I don\u2019t know who Musk\u2019s kids are and I have nothing against them. I wish them well. But they don\u2019t deserve a tax break of up to $80 billion.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\n\u2018Let\u2019s be clear. Inflation is not unique to America. It is an international crisis. In the European Union, inflation is nearly 11%. In Germany, it is 11.6%. In the United Kingdom it is 10.1%. In Ireland, it\u2019s 9.6%. In America, it\u2019s 8.2%, much too high, but lower than it is throughout much of Europe.\u2019\n\nHow would Republicans pay for this $1.75 trillion tax break to billionaires? They would pay for it by making massive cuts to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. This year, the 158-member Republican Study Committee in the House proposed cutting Medicare by $2.8 trillion and Social Security by $729 billion. An increasing number of Republicans have even threatened to default on our nation\u2019s debt unless they are able to enact cuts to Social Security and Medicare. How absurd is that?\n\nNo. You don\u2019t reduce inflation by giving tax breaks to billionaires and cutting benefits for the elderly, the sick, the children and the poor.\n\nYou combat inflation by taking on corporate greed and passing a windfall profits tax. You combat inflation by taking on the power of the insurance companies, the drug companies, the fossil fuel industry, the giant food companies and lowering the outrageously high costs of healthcare, prescription drugs, gas and groceries.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAs the longest serving Independent in congressional history, I\u2019m not going to tell you that Democrats are perfect.

Virginia Foxx, R.-N.C., who serves as the ranking member of the House Committee on Education and Labor, agreed that Biden ended IRAP to maintain federal control of local programs.\n\n\"Unfortunately, President Biden ended IRAPs because he wants to expand the federal government\u2019s control over the American workforce and drive workers into predominantly union-run apprenticeships,\" Foxx told Fox News Digital. \"This is the kind of political stunt that puts special interests and government bureaucracy over the needs of American workers. It is entirely unwarranted.\"\n\nThe White House declined to comment, but its press releases regarding Biden's decision to end IRAP argued the program undermined already effective apprenticeships overseen by the Department of Labor.\n\nApprentices receive training at their place of employment to develop skills for higher paying jobs, and these programs are most often established through a partnership between employers and labor unions. This is in large part due to the prevalence of the programs in industries with high levels of unionization, such as the three sectors Biden highlighted this week.\n\nLabor unions donated $27.5 million to Biden\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign and its affiliated groups.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBiden often boasts he is the most pro-labor union president in history.

The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Dobbs in late June was followed by an increase in voter registration among women, donations to Planned Parenthood and Google searches about abortion. Recently, abortion \"has faded\" as a top issue in polls.\n\nProminent Democrats have warned their party to talk less about abortion and more about economic angst. Sure, many women (and men) care about abortion, but polls show it is being trumped by the weekly demands of filling up the gas tank and grocery cart, and the monthly demands of rent and mortgage, utilities and insurance, car and tuition payments.\n\nYet the Democrats can't help themselves. They arrogantly think they own \"women\u2019s issues\" and have taken for granted a conventional political gender gap that has narrowed, one that hardly helped Hillary Clinton become \"the first woman president.\" Lately it seems Democrats speak to women mostly from the waist down, while Republicans speak to women from the waist up, where our brains, eyes, ears, mouths and hearts are.\n\nKELLYANNE CONWAY: REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES MUST NOT LET DEMOCRATS \u2018SLINK AWAY\u2019 FROM BIDEN'S MISTAKES\n\nALL issues are \"women\u2019s issues.\" Women are multi-taskers and multi-thinkers.

Trump it is without obsession or delusion. It is with a yearning for $2.14 gas prices, 1.4% inflation, energy independence, border security, Putin out of Ukraine and police on the streets.

Herz responded that Biden had the authority to initiate the action, the Treasury Department could execute the action and there would be a \"diplomatic component\" also.\n\nIn addition, a few months later, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) contacted Young to schedule an \"ambition accelerator\" meeting with multiple environmental groups pushing green transition policies.\n\n\"We are fully aware [REDACTED] schedule is insane, but we'd be grateful for a bit of time to discuss as we see this as one of the major political outcomes \u2026 we need to land this week,\" Brendan Guy, the director of NRDC's international program, wrote to Young on Nov. 8, 2021, amid the UN climate conference.\n\nGuy proposed for the meeting to include leaders from NRDC, World Resources Institute (WRI), E3G and the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions. Guy confirmed availability for later in the week in the final email included in the documents obtained by PPT.\n\nGOP LAWMAKERS DEMAND ANSWERS FROM JOHN KERRY OVER \u2018EFFECTIVELY OUTSOURCING\u2019 US POLICY-MAKING\n\nThe emails showing coordination on policy with the Sierra Club and NRDC are the latest evidence that Kerry's office has communicated with far-left green groups on such issues.\n\nSeparate email dumps obtained by PPT in August and September and shared with Fox News Digital showed that the SPEC office consulted with environmental groups on multiple other occasions. In some cases, environmental groups even appeared to act as a go-between in certain international climate discussions involving Kerry's office.\n\nThe internal communications, though, haven't shown any similar meetings or discussions with fossil fuel industry stakeholders.\n\n\"One of the foundational elements of the American constitutional system of government is that the public has a say in how they are governed,\" PPT Director Michael Chamberlain told FOX News Digital. \"In the executive branch this is expressed via officials who are appointed by the President.\"\n\n\"Each set of documents PPT has obtained from the State Department reveals the blurred line between the President's appointees who are supposed to work for the American public and powerful special interests who work for unknown billionaires and, in some cases, have questionable ties to the Chinese government,\" he continued. \"The more we learn, the more it calls into question whether policy from John Kerry\u2019s office is being outsourced to special interests with an agenda that could be driving America's energy and inflation crises.\"\n\nRepublican lawmakers have also expressed concerns in light of the documents and communications showing coordination with green groups.\n\nJUDICIAL WATCH SUES BIDEN ADMIN OVER JOHN KERRY'S TRAVEL COSTS, CALENDAR, STAFFER INFO\n\n\"The American people need to know administration officials are looking out for the interests of our own nation,\" Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., the ranking member on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, told Fox News Digital in a statement Monday. \"It\u2019s clear that John Kerry is pushing the agenda of left wing special interest groups.\"\n\n\"The last thing we need is to strangle investment in proven energy sources in the middle of an energy crisis,\" he continued. \"That\u2019s exactly what Kerry is trying to do. He should come clean about his relationship with these groups and explain how they\u2019ve influenced his destructive policies.\"\n\nAnd GOP leaders on the House Foreign Affairs Committee and Oversight and Reform Committee have announced two separate congressional inquiries into Kerry's office in response to the previous Fox News Digital reports.\n\nAxios reported last week that Kerry was considering soon resigning from his post to avoid congressional oversight should Republicans win back majority control of the House. However, Kerry vehemently denied the reports.\n\nJOHN KERRY'S FAMILY PRIVATE JET EMITTED OVER 300 METRIC TONS OF CARBON SINCE BIDEN TOOK OFFICE\n\n\"The Department of State regularly responds to requests for informational briefings from non-governmental stakeholders,\" a State Department spokesperson told Fox News Digital in an email.\n\n\"In advance of the 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP27), the Office of the Special Presidential Envoy for Climate provided responsive briefings for a wide range of U.S. stakeholders including with religious and faith leaders, state and local governments, tribal leaders, youth organizations, environmental organizations, and U.S. businesses and trade associations,\" they continued.\n\nThe spokesperson noted that Kerry delivered remarks at CERAWeek, a major energy industry conference, earlier this year when asked whether the SPEC office has consulted with fossil fuel groups.\n\nPresident Biden appointed Kerry to be the first-ever SPEC, a cabinet-level position tasked with engaging in climate negotiations with foreign nations, shortly after taking office in January 2021. Kerry's office is housed at the State Department and has an estimated $13.9 million annual budget with approval for 45 personnel.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBut since Kerry's appointment, which didn't require Senate approval and grants him a seat on the National Security Council, his office has been tight-lipped about its staff and operations.

Wade\" with limitations.\n\n\"We cannot go back 50 years,\" Murkowski said, referencing the 1973 decision. \"But abortion should not be without limitation.\"\n\nALASKA CONGRESSIONAL DEBATE: PELTOLA, PALIN, BEGICH AND BYE SQUARE OFF ON INFLATION, GAS PRICES, STUDENT LOANS\n\nShe also said she would support any bipartisan effort that includes a provision that would allow healthcare workers to object to performing abortions based on their religion or conscience.\n\nTshibaka, a Trump-endorsed Republican, approached the issue differently and called for a nationwide cap on all abortions during the second trimester, or once an unborn child feels pain.\n\nShe called Democrats\u2019 until-birth abortion \"extreme\" and said legislation surrounding abortion should make birth control more accessible.\n\nChesbro, the sole Democrat on the stage, said the federal government should have no say in the procedure.\n\n\"I really am pro-choice at the discretion of the individual - not anyone else. We need to let people make the decision on their own,\" she said.\n\nThe candidates were also asked about their faith in voting systems and how to better instill voter confidence in elections.\n\nTshibaka called for state-based systems that promote \"transparency and accountability.\" She also said she would oppose any effort to allow for the \"federalization of voting systems.\"\n\nThe Republican challenger specifically said voters would have \"more confidence\" in elections with signature verification.\n\nChesbro said she \"voted yesterday\" and was \"impressed with the people at the voter polls.\"\n\n\"I am wary of things we hear around the country of people intimidating people,\" she added. \"We need to make sure people have faith in the system.\"\n\nMurkowski said elections \"must be a cornerstone of what we believe in\" and called for them to be \"fair, transparent, free and accessible.\"\n\nThe candidates were asked about the ongoing House Jan. 6 investigation and if former President Donald Trump, who was subpoenaed by the committee, should be forced to testify. They were also asked if they believed Trump committed any crimes.\n\nChesbro answered first, saying Trump should testify but did not say one way or the other if he broke the law.\n\n\"I think he should testify,\" she said. \"The way to establish your innocence is to testify.\"\n\n\"I have no idea if he broke the law,\" Chesbro added. \"The American citizens need to hear from him. Yes, he should testify,\" she reiterated.\n\nMurkowski, who voted last year to convict Trump on charges of \"incitement of insurrection\" over the Jan. 6 riot, said Trump should \"accept [the subpoena] and testify.\"\n\n\"I doubt that he will,\" she added. \"When a subpoena is issued to a former president, it is not done lightly.\"\n\nDespite her previous vote, Murkowski stopped shy of claiming Trump committed a crime.\n\n\"I think the process will determine [if he committed a crime],\" she said. \"I think this is something left unfinished in the minds of so many in this country.\"\n\nTshibaka disagreed, challenging the legality of the subpoena and casting doubt that Trump should be held accountable in the same way as those who stormed the Capitol.\n\n\"The legality of the subpoena is being determined in the courts. The people who broke into the capitol should be held accountable,\" she said.\n\nTshibaka also suggested Alaskan voters are not concerned about Trump or the Jan. 6 protests as she has not heard it on the campaign trail.\n\nRegarding climate change and Typhoon Merbok, which devastated areas with high winds and floods in Western Alaska, the candidates agreed that more should be done to protect vulnerable communities.\n\n\"I wish there was an easy answer. The damage breaks your heart,\" Murkowski responded.\n\nTshibaka followed up: \"Obviously, it\u2019s devastating, and we are at risk of more of this kind of damage.\"\n\nChesbro joined: \"I think we have the capacity to develop housing that is more resilient. We have to help people, and we have to move fast to do that.\"\n\nAt different points of the debate, the candidates were able to ask their opponents a question. After the answer was given, the person who asked was allowed a rebuttal and the third candidate was also invited to weigh in on the issue.\n\nThe first question went to Murkowski, who challenged Tshibaka to defend her criticism of infrastructure legislation Biden signed into law.\n\n\"How can you deny the benefits of the bill to Alaska?\" the incumbent asked.\n\nTshibaka cited the Wall Street Journal editorial board in calling the law a \"bait and switch\" and said the Biden administration was continuing to hide money via regulatory hurdles from being used.\n\n\"We cant wait any longer for infrastructure developments,\" she added.\n\nWHAT IS RANKED CHOICE VOTING, THE NEW ELECTION PROCESS USED IN ALASKA?\n\nMurkowski said the entire Alaska delegation supported the legislation and assured the funding is still coming.\n\nTshibaka later returned the favor in asking Murkowski why she initially campaigned against \"dark money\" being used by \"outsiders\" in the \"lower 48\" to influence Alaska elections but was now a recipient of such money: \"Why are you beholden from dark money from the outside?\"\n\n\"This could not be further from the truth,\" Murkowski interjected. \"We recognize there are outside groups weighing in. They are weighing in on my campaign, your campaign and a host of campaigns.\"\n\nShe added: \"As a candidate, we cannot control that. It might be frustrating, but we can't control that.\"\n\nAs a rebuttal, Tshibaka claimed the money turns Murkowski\u2019s loyalty away from Alaska voters and towards Washington, D.C.\n\n\"I think we all know how D.C. works,\" she said. \"When they come in and help you keep your Senate seat, you owe them favors.\"\n\n\"We don't want a politician, we want a public servant,\" she added.\n\nChesbro responded that campaign money, in general, should be evaluated.\n\n\"Nobody owns me. Lots of individuals give me money, but I think money is a problem in races across the country. If you don't have money, sometimes, you can't get your voice out there,\" she said.\n\nCandidates also fielded questions from people on social media and via video, concerning transgender rights, gun violence, rising gas prices, salmon and snow crab fisheries, the Supreme Court, and climate change.\n\nOn gun rights and gun ownership, Chesbro said she would \"look at curbing gun violence in a different way.\"\n\n\"We have a problem with suicide,\" she added. \"Let's keep our guns safe and locked up, so people can't make this decision quickly.\"\n\nMurkowski pointed to gun violence in schools and said more funds should go to schools without \"turning them into fortresses.\"\n\nTRUMP-BACKED TSHIBAKA PROJECTED TO DEFEAT 20-YEAR INCUMBENT SEN. MURKOWSKI, ELECTION FORECASTER SAYS\n\nTshibaka instead advocated for \"more funding for school counselors.\"\n\n\"I do not support additional restrictions on law-abiding citizens,\" she added.\n\nThe candidates were also asked to grade the country\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nMurkowski started: \"In terms of how quickly we developed a vaccine, we get an A. I give Alaska a real strong grade to ensure a level of understanding about what we were dealing with for COVID and the importance to getting a vaccination.\"\n\n\"In terms of the nationwide response, I think we failed there,\" she added. \"I think we can and must do better.\"\n\nTshibaka highlighted penalties paid by employees who objected to receiving the vaccine, including members of the military, who were fired or forced to take leave.\n\n\"We need to honor the constitutional rights of the service members. I want to sponsor a bill that says they get their pay, retirement, and benefits restored,\" she said.\n\nThe sole Democrat said the country was particularly \"ineffective\" in how they coordinated schooling for children. She called months of remote schooling \"chaotic\" as teachers and students were not prepared to teach or learn at a distance.\n\nTIM SCOTT DEFENDS MURKOWSKI ENDORSEMENT AMID BLOWBACK FROM THE RIGHT: 'I LIKE TO WIN'\n\nEach candidate was asked about U.S. Supreme Court nominees and their confirmation process.\n\nMurkowski called the process \"broken\" and said her Senate colleagues were not properly vetting the candidates. \"We have to go back to actually evaluating the qualifications of these nominees,\" she said.\n\n\"We are evaluating them on what president appointed them,\" she said, calling out both parties of providing an \"automatic rubber stamp or roadblock.\"\n\nTshibaka plainly said she would support \"constitutionalist nominees to the Supreme Court regardless of who appoints them.\"\n\nLater in the debate, Tshibaka and Murkowski said they were definitely against a federal ban on high-powered rifles, while Chesbro said she would support one.\n\n\"When we make these guns illegal, criminals will still get them,\" Tshibaka said.\n\nChesbro countered: \"I support the ban, there is no purpose in these guns other than killing people. I am against murder.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe debate was hosted by Alaska\u2019s News Source, Alaska Public Media, and KTOO.\n\nIt was moderated by Alaska Public Media News Director Lori Townsend and Alaska\u2019s News Source Managing Editor Mike Ross."}, {"title": "7 Biden-Harris quotes that will come back to haunt them in midterm elections", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/7-biden-harris-quotes-haunt-them-midterm-elections", "tag": "OPINION", "content": "NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n\nOver the past two years, Americans have watched the Democrat Party and their allies on the left become radicalized right before their eyes.\n\nWhether it was the Defund the Police movement, the economy-killing Green New Deal, the insane open border policy, or the brutally divisive rhetoric, time and time again President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have done the bidding of radical far left-wing forces that have a vice grip on today\u2019s Democrats.\n\nNow, less than three weeks before the 2022 midterm elections and with Democratic prospects for holding onto their razor-thin majorities in Congress grimmer than ever, polls are indicating that Biden, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and their comrades on the left are about to face their day of reckoning.\n\nWhen it was time to stand soberly with police, Democrats fanned the flames of chaos and the failed concept of \"reimagining\" policing. When it was time to rebuild our economy in a responsible manner after the COVID-19 lockdowns, Democrats spent taxpayer dollars like drunken sailors and caused an inflation crisis that now has no end in sight. And when they didn't get their way trying to enact their socialist wish list, never forget that Democrats threatened to pack the U.S. Supreme Court with like-minded radicals.\n\nGOP TSUNAMI IS SWEEPING AWAY DEMOCRAT HOPES FOR MIDTERM ELECTIONS\n\nDuring the Democrats\u2019 transition to radicalization, various statements, speeches and comments were made along the way that Biden, Harris and the left are going to regret come Election Day. Here are seven of the most infamous examples that hopefully help pave the way for a convincing Democrat defeat come Nov. 8.\n\n1. Joe Biden: \"Talking inflation \u2013 the overwhelming consensus is it\u2019s going to pop up a little bit and then go back down.\"\n\nThe inflation crisis that we\u2019re all struggling mightily with is manmade and the man\u2019s name is Joe Biden. The president ignored all the warnings and signed into law trillions upon trillions in new federal spending when our economy was already overheating - just to appease the radical left. Now, it could take years and a devastating economic recession before we\u2019re able to climb out of the hole that this president and the Pelosi-Schumer Congress have put us all in.\n\n2. Kamala Harris: \"For far too long the status quo thinking has been to believe that by putting more police on the street you're going to have more safety. And that's just wrong, that's not how it works.\"\n\nIn the wake of George Floyd\u2019s horrible death, when riots were happening all over the country, Biden and Harris picked up the mantle of the radical left instead of calling for law and order. At a time when it was important for cooler heads to prevail, Biden supported redirecting police funding and Harris even helped bail rioters out of jail. Now, America is in the throes of a crime crisis and people don\u2019t feel safe in their own neighborhoods. The bottom line is that police are now far less respected because of the actions of the leftist \"squad\" and the defund the police movement. The vast majority of Americans believe the fundamental truth that police have a dangerous job keeping us safe and that they should be thanked rather than insulted \u2013 something Harris doesn\u2019t understand.\n\nDEMOCRATS OBLIVIOUS TO RISING TIDE OF UNHAPPY VOTERS MAY BE SHOCKED BY REPUBLICAN MIDTERM WINS\n\n3. Joe Biden: \"We do not ask any nation to choose between the United States or any other partner.\"\n\nAt a time of great uncertainty around the world, words of moral equivalency by an American president speaking before the United Nations General Assembly are as weak as they are dangerous. Our allies as well as our enemies need to hear that what Russia is doing in Ukraine is mass murder, what China is doing to the Uyghurs is genocide, and what Iran is doing to women is barbaric. Creating a woke military while projecting weakness abroad is terrible policy and makes the world a more dangerous place.\n\n4. Kamala Harris: \"We have a secure border.\"\n\nThese are the words of a career politician \u2013 our so-called \"Border Czar\" \u2013 who thinks everyday Americans are stupid. Ever since Biden sent pro-amnesty signals during the campaign and signed his irresponsible executive orders the moment he got into the Oval Office, the American people have been watching our wide open southern border on television. The result has been a humanitarian crisis, a national security crisis, a human trafficking crisis, and a deadly fentanyl crisis that is killing Americans at an alarming rate.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\n5. Joe Biden: \"This is Jim Crow on steroids what they\u2019re doing in Georgia and 40 other states.\"\n\nBiden repeated variations of this lie for months in his divisive attacks against Republican governors and legislatures that passed legislation to make it easier to vote and harder to cheat in their states\u2019 elections. Instead of actually reading the bills, Biden repeated the left\u2019s hate-filled talking points by comparing tens of millions Americans to segregationists. When Biden asked, \"Do you want to be the side of Dr. King or George Wallace? Do you want to be on the side of John Lewis or Bull Connor?\" he turned out to be way off base because voter turnout is continuing to increase across our country \u2013 even in Georgia \u2013 the target of the left\u2019s dishonest vitriol.\n\n6. Joe Biden: \"The Justice Department in my administration will be totally independent of me.\"\n\nSince Biden took office, Attorney General Merrick Garland has ordered an unprecedented raid of the home of Biden\u2019s possible 2024 political opponent, targeted parents who dared speak out at school board meetings about critical race theory, and refused to appoint an impartial special counsel to investigate the president\u2019s son Hunter Biden, despite the obvious need to do so. The Biden Department of Justice is setting a horrible precedent because their actions are having a corrosive effect at all levels of government that will take decades to unwind.

Joe Biden: \"MAGA Republicans look at America and see carnage and darkness and despair.\"\n\n\"Unity is the path forward,\" Biden said in his inaugural address when he pledged to bring our divided nation together. But just a year and a half later, Biden did the exact opposite when he delivered a prime time address to essentially label 74 million Americans a threat to democracy. Sadly, since taking office, Biden has repeatedly chosen to be the champion of the radical left instead of the moderate statesman he promised to be.\n\nThe radicalization of the Democrat Party has had a devastating effect on our economy, safety and security, and it\u2019s time for a change in leadership. Never forget that when it mattered most, the Democrats caved to the radical left time and time again instead of governing responsibly for all the American people."}, {"title": "GDP boost too little, too late to help Democrats, strategists say", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gdp-boost-too-little-too-late-help-democrats-strategists", "tag": "MIDTERM ELECTIONS", "content": "Congressional Democrats got some good economic news Thursday amid 40-year high inflation, but it likely comes too late to benefit the party ahead of the November midterm elections.\n\nThe Commerce Department reported that gross domestic product, the broadest measure of goods and services produced in the economy, grew by 2.6% over the last three months.

In 2022, it seems that voters feel the same way they did exactly 30 years ago. This year, when it comes to how people are going to cast their votes in the voting booth, it is still the economy, stupid.\n\nDemocrats were certainly handed a bit of a break over the summer when voters retaliated against the activist Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn almost a half-century of precedent on Roe v. Wade. This decision to return to the states the ability to regulate a woman\u2019s choice over her own body was met with swift rejection in deep red states like Kansas and Alaska and polls across the country tightened. Candidates rushed to focus their television advertisements on the radical abortion views of the Republican Party, and Democrats like me saw a glimmer of a silver lining in the approaching dark clouds. Yet, as we approach the final weeks of the election season, it seems that much of this voter anger on abortion has dissipated, and the focus has returned to inflation, gas prices and the economy.\n\nEarlier this year, voters ranked economic issues as more important than social issues by a fairly narrow 31%-23% margin. Today, 49% of voters say economic issues are the most important, including 22% who list inflation as their top singular issue. Only 26% say social issues, of which 6% say abortion is the most important. This 6% is the same percentage of voters focused on solving immigration, creating affordable healthcare, and restoring honesty and integrity to Washington. Even worse, 60% of voters now believe that we are in a recession, including a majority of both Democratic and Independent voters.\n\nDEMOCRATS PUSH FOR STRONGER ECONOMIC MESSAGE AHEAD OF MIDTERMS: 'WE'VE GOT TO DO A BETTER JOB'\n\nThankfully, there are sole Democrats who are getting it right. In both the Arizona and Ohio U.S. Senate races, Democratic U.S. Senator Mark Kelly and Rep. Tim Ryan have focused almost exclusively on a populist economic message that resonates with Trump voters. This ability to thread the needle and take the fight to out-of-touch venture capitalists like Blake Masters and J.D. Vance, should serve as a blueprint for other Democratic candidates in the final stretch of the campaign.\n\nAs is oft-repeated each election cycle, the first midterm for an incumbent president\u2019s party is usually a heartbreaker for those in power. The American voter seems to relish in rejecting the party they just elected: even when that party is, like Biden-led Democrats, one of the most successful in history.\n\nSo, over the next two weeks, Democrats in every corner of the country need to be honest with their voters about economic issues and explain how we got here, and what Democrats have done to fix the mess we were in. Those running up and down the ballot on Team Blue need to stop focusing on too-cute-by-half tweets and instead focus on the kitchen-table issues which will actually decide this election.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nEach candidate should shout from the rooftops the success we have achieved for the American people: 10 million jobs created by this administration, including 700,000 manufacturing jobs; a 50-year low unemployment rate; and the largest ever one-year decline in the deficit, a $1.5 trillion reduction. Democrats also passed a trillion-dollar infrastructure bill that\u2019s already breaking ground on projects across the country, passed a tax credit for parents that brought child poverty to the lowest point in history, and finally passed a bill allowing Medicare to negotiate the cost of prescription drugs, which will cut health care costs dramatically for Americans.\n\nOn Friday from the White House, President Joe Biden took the fight to the GOP in pointed remarks on the economy, zeroing in on reckless GOP promises to use the debt ceiling as leverage to cut American\u2019s social safety net and Republican goals to reverse popular programs. \"Folks, we know what the Republicans in Congress will do if they regain power.

Crime and a spike in crime rates\n\nMajor cities across the U.S. in Red and Blue states have seen a surge in violent crime since the pandemic, with homicides hitting historic highs in 2020 and 2021.\n\nAccording to figures from the Council on Criminal Justice, homicides in 2022 are still 39% higher than during the same period in 2019, with property crimes, violent crimes, and drug offenses also seeing increases this year.\n\nAs the party traditionally tied to law and order, Republicans have made crime a key part of their midterms messaging, frequently calling out Democrat opponents who previously supported defunding the police in the aftermath of Black Lives Matter protests in 2020.\n\nCrime has continued to poll higher on voters' concerns in the final weeks of the midterms, often coming in second to inflation, with a majority of voters trusting Republicans over Democrats on crime by a 15 point margin, according to a Fox News Poll.\n\n3. Abortion and abortion rights\n\nThe Supreme Court's June decision to overturn Roe v. Wade brought abortion to the forefront of national debate this summer. Until that decision, midterms messaging was focused almost entirely on the economy and crime, but the Supreme Court leak and subsequent ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization thrust the social issue into the midterms conversation and gave new momentum to Democrats.\n\nMany Democrat candidates refocused their midterms messaging to abortion following the SCOTUS decision. In fact, Planned Parenthood announced a record-breaking midterm spending plan of $50 million in key races, Fox News Digital reported.\n\nDemocrats saw a bump in generic congressional polling and the midterms appeared more competitive for the first time all cycle.\n\nDespite heightened interest in abortion, especially among Democrat voters, some political commentators question the potency of the issue come election day, worrying that Democrat candidates might be leaning too heavily on the issue at a time when inflation and crime continue to top concerns of key voter blocs.\n\n4. Immigration and border security\n\nThe United States experienced the highest recorded number of illegal border crossings in American history this year, with over 2 million encounters recorded this fiscal year alone.\n\nThe issue has remained a central theme throughout the midterms, consistently polling high on the list of voter concerns according to national polls.\n\nOver the past year, governors of border states have sounded the alarm over the growing border crisis and its detrimental effects to their states' citizens and resources. The issue gained national attention in the midterms when Republican Governors Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., and Greg Abbot, R-Texas, sent busses of illegal migrants to New York, Washington D.C, and Martha\u2019s Vineyard.\n\nImmigration and border security are another issue set where Republicans have held an advantage among likely voters.\n\nBIDEN CLAIMS REPUBLICANS WILL CRASH THE ECONOMYM ON PURPOSE AHEAD OF MIDTERMS: \u2018MEGA-MAGA TRICKLE DOWN\u2019\n\n5. Threats to Democracy\n\nThreats to democracy has been an issue of top importance to Democrats in the midterms, topping out inflation and abortion in several national polls.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has called attention to the issue in recent campaign speeches, denouncing \"extreme MAGA Republicans\" and the threat they pose to democracy. This point was central to Biden's \"Battle for the Soul of the Nation\" speech in Pennsylvania where he accused MAGA Republicans of waging an \"assault on American democracy.\"\n\nIn Congress, Democrats have attempted to keep this issue front-and-center ahead of the midterms.

In the October Harvard CAPS-Harris Poll, 55 percent of voters, including 42 percent of Democrats, blamed Biden for inflation. They believe that the \"American Rescue Plan\" was too much government spending at the moment the economy was recovering from the pandemic and the result was to let the inflation genie out of the bottle again. Whether that is in fact true is something economists will no doubt debate, but former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers accurately predicted the impact of the bill and warned of its effect.\n\nThe electoral impact of this issue is singularly powerful. We define \u2018the inflation electorate' as the 25 percent of respondents in September\u2019s Harvard-Harris Poll who say that inflation is their number one concern for the midterms and that their personal financial situation is worsening. Nearly half these voters are Democrats or Independents but the Congressional generic ballot among them favors the Republicans by a lopsided 69 percent to 31 percent. It is in my view that inflation and its impact is the key factor giving Republicans the clear edge in these midterms.\n\nWhen asked in recent polling whether voters believed the cure for inflation should be higher taxes or lower government spending, the voters chose a smaller government. Sixty-seven percent of voters said they are more likely to vote for a candidate who supports addressing inflation by reducing federal government spending, according to the NBC News poll. Many may recall the most famous line of Bill Clinton\u2019s 1996 State of the Union: \"The era of big government is over.\" The last few years have been more like the old Jack Nicholson horror movie in which he declares \"I\u2019m back!\" And so today government is bigger than ever and even record tax receipts cannot cover the trillions of dollars of new spending.\n\nVoters see through the title of the \"Inflation Reduction Act.\" Sixty percent of the inflation electorate believe that the bill will in fact cause more inflation, according to the Harris Poll. On top of that Biden has put through a student debt reduction plan that is estimated to spend somewhere between $400 and $700 billion. When we asked the inflation voters how they felt about this plan, 11 percent of them said that the debt relief will help them personally, and 52 percent said the plan makes them less likely to vote Democratic.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nIt is time for smart politicians, whether they be Democrat or Republican, to go back to the basics of fiscal responsibility as the linchpin of financial security for this and future generations.

Here's one of them. When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade this past June (You remember this) Democrats howled in outrage for weeks. Every hour on MSNBC sounded like a plot summary from The Handmaid's Tale. Theocracy rising! They'll be burning witches. Liberals seemed genuinely upset and probably most were, but on some level, not very deep beneath the surface, the people who run the Democratic Party weren't upset at all. They were thrilled.\n\nHere finally was an issue for them to run on in the midterm elections. It was an issue perfectly suited to a party that had nothing else to talk about. Are they going to brag about Joe Biden? I don't think so, so it's going to be abortion. They're going to take your abortions away. That was the Democratic message for the midterm elections , the ones that are coming up in just a few days, but there was a problem with the messaging.\n\nCOVID had just ended and people, not being entirely stupid, still remember that this very same Democratic Party, the same people, had forced the entire population to wear paper masks like children and then to take the shot as a condition of going outside. So, women have the right to control their own bodies? They used to tell us that and then they fired thousands of nurses for refusing to submit to an experimental vaccine.\n\nThe phrase \"my body, my choice\" had been, as we say in the news business, overtaken by events. Clearly, Democrats needed a new slogan, a new way to talk about abortion. Unfortunately, nobody could think of one. \"Your body, my choice?\" No, that wouldn't work. It was too real. In the end, liberals just dusted off the same old talking points and pretended like COVID never happened.

This message says, \"Oh, you don't really care about your right to control your own bodies, dears. It's the economy, stupid.\" You've got a media narrative that says that women don't really care about abortion, women don't really mind if the states control their bodies. They don't care about that. They just care about the price of milk.\n\nYeah, it would be a shame if states got to control people's bodies, like telling people what to wear on their faces or what drugs they have to be injected with. That'd be like The Handmaid's Tale! Theocracy! Next, they'll be trying to control what you read on social media. Oh, wait. It's all pretty amusing and the good news is that for once, lines this preposterous are not working. Abortion politics is a total fixation of Democratic donors. It's the main thing they care about. Why is that, by the way? It's a religion. It's a child sacrifice cult, but not everyone else feels that way, even Democrats.\n\nAs The Daily Caller just reported, polls show that \"abortion is not a top priority for female voters.\" In fact, \"most women support abortion limits that would have been considered unconstitutional under the Roe v. Wade precedent.\"\n\nOh. So, it looks like yelling about abortion is definitely not going to be enough to keep Democrats in control of the Congress. Are you surprised by that? No, of course not. You live here.

In fact, there are still plenty of people in this country, believe it or not, who have happy marriages. There are still people who love their kids and their grandchildren, still people who consider babies a blessing, not just an obstacle to better vacation.\n\nNow, some of those people, maybe a lot of those people, might still consider themselves \"pro-choice,\" but they're hardly pro-abortion. They don't think abortion is a positive good. It's not. They don't consider it liberation. and they definitely don't see abortion, as Janet Yellen recently claimed, as the answer to our national economic problems. She said that.\n\nHere's how it works: Janet Yellen gets rich giving speeches to the companies she regulates. That's corruption, but she's never charged. She's still free. In fact, she's the treasury secretary. And you? You get poorer, but we have a solution. You just need to have more abortions. That's what she said. That's the message they're selling and maybe not surprisingly, it doesn't work. That's not what voters want. So, what do voters want? What do they care about?\n\nWHITE HOUSE GROUNDSKEEPER HAS SERVED PRESIDENTS, FAMILIES AND PETS IN 50 YEARS ON THE JOB\n\nWell, if you look at the polls, they care about exactly what you'd expect them to care about, which is the quality of their own lives. They care about the economy and they care about crime . This is very obvious. You don't even need to look at polling to know it, but every poll shows it with maximum clarity. How does the media respond to this? Well, of course, doing their job. they've done everything possible to minimize both issues, the economy and crime.\n\nThey've told us the economy is not in a recession. No, it's not. One, of course, by every measure, it is very much in a recession. And on crime, they've told you, don't even talk about it. Only racists worry about crime. Racists! The one thing you don't want to be called.\n\nHow should Republicans respond to that? Well, we have video evidence.

Watch this.\n\nREPORTER: A lot of people of color feel like they\u2019re being targeted.\n\nKARI LAKE: A lot of people of color? A lot of people of color? How many people of color have you talked to about that?\n\nREPORTER: I mean, if you look at surveys.\n\nVOTERS WILL DETERMINE THE FUTURE OF ABORTION LAWS IN THESE FIVE STATES\n\nLAKE: Which surveys? I'm happy to look at those stats because I will tell you this, that I talk to people of color. I talk to all Arizonans. They're all concerned about the crime. Just because their skin isn't the same color as yours, doesn't mean you want your kids to be walking down the street in an unsafe neighborhood. Every Arizonan wants safety and security in their neighborhood. It doesn't matter what your skin color is and if you look at stats, you will look and see that police do not target people of color. That is a lie that's been perpetuated by the left and then spread and disseminated and spread in the media. Check the stats.\n\nSo great! The reporter says, well, people of color are concerned about your crime policies because, of course, being a White liberal, all White liberals know, if they know one thing, that they have a right to speak for \"people of color,\" not to people of color, something they really do, but for, on behalf of people of color. Kari Lake stops at that. Really, what people of color? All Republicans running for office should watch that video.\n\nbut in the end, you don't need to convince people that crime is real because they live here, too.

ACTION\n\nIn New York, crime on public transit is up more than 40% and not just pickpocketing. Now, this video that we're about to show you is not an aberration necessarily. It just so happens this was caught on tape, but this is exactly the reason that people are afraid to ride the subway. This weekend, a man was pushed onto the tracks. You can guess the motive actually from watching this video, but we know with no warning whatsoever. Here it is.\n\nALEXIS MCADAMS: 32-year-old David Martin is afraid for his safety after this random attack. He's in physical and emotional pain as he continues to replay this horrifying moment caught on camera over and over again. In this video, you can see the guy in the yellow hoodie shove him right onto the subway tracks. He zeroed in on the innocent commuter and then charged right at him. Martin ended up in the hospital, just grateful to be alive.\n\nOh, this random attack. There are a lot of random attacks on the Internet you may have noticed. Are they random? Really? The person who did that is not being sought as a hate criminal. You wonder why.\n\nBut the point is, those kinds of attacks didn't used to happen. Now they're commonplace enough that you may no longer be shocked by them, but if you live there, you stay off the subway as a result. Crime in Philadelphia is completely out of control. For example, last year, Philadelphia recorded 562 murders.\n\nCANDIDATE SPOTLIGHT: ARIZONA DEMOCRAT CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR KATIE HOBBS TALKS ABORTION, INFLATION\n\nThat is the highest homicide total since 1960. That happens to be the year the city started tracking homicide data. This year in Philadelphia, crimes like robbery with a gun are up 47%. Now, why is this happening? It's not an accident. None of this is an accident. Crime is rising as a direct result of policies designed to make crime rise and at the same time, any effort by normal people, middle class people, to defend themselves is immediately met with the full ferocity of the state. This is an attempt, of course, to destroy the American middle class. Let's just be honest about it.\n\nThis is crime with a purpose. They don't want to have this conversation, the people who did this, and that's why they attack you personally and morally if you bring it up. In Philadelphia, a lot of these crimes can be traced to one man, Soros-backed D.A. Larry Krasner. He's decided not to charge many robbers with crimes. Arrests and charges for retail theft in Philadelphia have dropped by about 70% over the past four years. In that same period, reports of robberies jumped more than 20%. You see how this works?\n\nIf you stop charging people with certain crimes, they commit more of them. That seems like an obvious observation and again, it's more evidence this is not an accident. Larry Krasner is not an idiot. None of these people are stupid. They're doing this on purpose. They're trying to destroy and why are they doing that? Well, we can't guess as to the motive, but they're definitely doing it.\n\nWhen asked about this, how does Larry Krasner respond? Shut up. Racist. Watch.\n\nGEORGIA TRIAL WILL DETERMINE FATE OF ABORTION LAW\n\nLARRY KRASNER: We're just looking at Philly right now in a superheated election cycle where part of the Republican playbook, as you well know, is to point a finger at large diverse cities and say large, diverse cities are lawless.

It's about blaming the biggest city in Pennsylvania with the most diverse population for having the same national struggle that we have with gun violence everywhere.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOh. Diversity, racism, diversity, racism. Shut up, shut up, shut up. Here you have another White liberal deputizing himself to speak for people of color against his political opponents.

Are you getting tired of it yet?\n\nVoters are getting very tired of this, so tired of it that even some Democrats have started to figure out actually maybe voters don't want to be shot, raped or carjacked and then attacked morally if they don't like it.\n\nKathy Hochul, who is in part responsible for the rising crime in New York, is now running last ditch ads promising to fight crime.\n\nOh, really, Kathy Hochul, but it's probably too late for her.

President George H. W. Bush was seeking re-election but given the prevailing recession and growing economic uncertainty, Carville identified the pain point that would ultimately deliver votes to secure the presidency for the Democrats.\n\nI was 4 years old in 1992, so I don\u2019t remember much from that year, yet that phrase, and more so the strategy behind the phrase, has been taught and discussed in the decades following its birth. As we enter the home stretch in what has shaped up to be another contentious election, the strategy and the sentiment from 30 years prior remains the same today.\n\nThe economy remains the top issue driving voters this election cycle. The New York Times released a survey that showed 26% of voters view the economy as the most important problem facing the country (the highest in percentage compared to any other issue), and broadly, 78% of voters, according to the Morning Consult, view the economy as a top issue when deciding who to vote for in November. On top of that, CBS News released a survey that found 65% of voters believe the economy is getting worse and 68% say the Biden administration could do more to combat inflation.\n\nDEMOCRAT-CONTROLLED NEVADA COULD BE SEEING RED IN MIDTERM ELECTIONS\n\nIn Nevada, a state with one of the most contentious Senate races this cycle, is being hit hard by inflation. As of August, the state saw a surge in inflation, hitting 15.4% (almost double than the national rate). Broken down and annualized, that\u2019s roughly $9,975 per household, or over $800 a month for basic goods and services. On top of that, Nevada is seeing no relief at the gas pump. The statewide average for a gallon of gas is $5.20, compared to the national average of $3.87, making Nevada one of the highest gas price states in the union.\n\nColorado is seeing similar trends. The Consumer Price Index for all items less food and energy rose 7.7% over the last 12 months. Food prices have increased 11.8% and gas prices hover around $3.67 a gallon (compared to $2.17 two years ago). The state has seen housing prices skyrocket by 23.6% year-over-year, with a median home price around $600,000, which is 51% higher than the national average.\n\nThe incumbent Senate Democrats in both states face a big hurdle this November. Nevada\u2019s Catherine Cortez-Masto and Colorado\u2019s Michael Bennet, both Democrats and loyal Biden allies in the Senate, have contributed to the economic disaster we all are facing. In 2021, they passed the second-largest spending bill in American history - the American Rescue Plan - at a tune of $1.9 trillion. In August of this year, they voted for an additional $750 billion in government spending through the Inflation Reduction Act. With these two examples, Cortez-Masto and Bennet have authorized the U.S. government to spend over $2.65 trillion in a matter of 16 months. Not to mention the additional spending bills they\u2019ve passed within the same time frame or during their tenure in Washington.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nLegendary economist Milton Friedman once said \"inflation is an old, old disease. We\u2019ve had thousands of years of experience of it.\" And \"the only cure for inflation is to reduce the rate at which spending is growing.\" The cause of inflation, as Friedman would argue, \"is made in Washington and nowhere else,\" and I couldn\u2019t agree more.\n\nSince taking office in 2021, President Joe Biden has enacted policies through a series of legislation and executive action that have increased our nation\u2019s spending by $4.8 trillion. While some would like to argue that this is a Democrat problem, it isn\u2019t. Government spending transcends political party. For example, Donald Trump spent $6.7 trillion ($4.2 trillion of which to combat the effects of COVID-19) during his four years.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTherefore, acknowledging the root cause of inflation and working to rein in our government\u2019s spending habits is where the answer lies. This election is important, not only for you and me, but for future Americans. Are we willing to jeopardize America\u2019s future solely for cheap political wins?

Gas prices have risen 59.8 percent since Biden was sworn into office. That kind of jump has a huge day-to-day impact on Americans and their families, and it\u2019s a big bite out of the family budget when it costs $100 to fill up your tank instead of $60. Americans are feeling these financial consequences each time they fill up, and in November, Democrats will feel the political consequences.\n\nThe Strategic Petroleum Reserve was created as a backup energy supply in emergency scenarios. Historically, tapping into the SPR has not been taken lightly. Before Biden, U.S. presidents have authorized emergency sales from the SPR only three times \u2013 during the first Gulf War, in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, and to counter supply disruptions from Libya\u2019s civil war. It is unacceptable for the Biden administration to use our emergency oil reserves as a political tool to temporarily lower gas prices ahead of the election.\n\nI\u2019ve managed emergencies that required tapping the SPR. When Hurricane Harvey devastated Texas and Louisiana, I used my authority as Energy Secretary to loan thousands of barrels from the SPR to compensate for Harvey-caused refinery outages. The SPR was a vital tool at my disposal when Americans needed relief. But there is a key difference between what Biden is doing and what I did.\n\nDONALD TRUMP SAYS UKRAINE WAR SHOULD'VE 'NEVER' HAPPENED: PUTIN 'RESPECTED' ME\n\nMy Department of Energy coordinated with American producers and refiners to provide temporary aid until they could get back on their feet. Perhaps most importantly, I made sure the SPR was refilled. I fear Biden\u2019s unprecedented decision to drain our reserve will leave us unprepared for future emergencies.\n\nThe SPR is not the president\u2019s personal oil supply. Yet, Biden has been treating it as a political band-aid since he took office. According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), U.S. petroleum reserves are down 230 million barrels since Biden\u2019s Inauguration and are at the lowest they've been since the Summer of 1984. With levels dangerously low, the administration just requested the release of another 15 million barrels. By the end of the year, U.S. reserves will be down a staggering 255 million barrels.\n\nThis latest SPR release comes on the heels of another desperate attempt to lower gas prices. Earlier this month, the Biden administration reportedly asked OPEC+ to delay its decision to cut production, a play to push the cartel\u2019s decision to after the midterm election. OPEC+ ignored the administration\u2019s pleas and announced plans to cut production by 2 million barrels per day. This decision put the Biden administration in a bind, and with their backs against the wall, they resorted to their favorite stopgap solution \u2013 the SPR.\n\nThe fact is OPEC+\u2019s announcement wouldn\u2019t have impacted American gas prices if our country was energy independent. The energy crisis in Europe is a stark example of the consequences of sacrificing energy independence to meet aggressive green energy targets. Russia is strangling European energy supplies, and the best solution the Biden administration can muster is to sacrifice American energy security and constantly interfere in the ability of the market to stabilize itself.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nYet, since day one in office, Biden and his administration have been hostile to American energy production and infrastructure \u2013 shutting down pipeline projects like Keystone XL and layering permitting red tape. Instead of unleashing energy here at home, Biden officials are engaging in dictator diplomacy, imploring them to fix this self-inflicted crisis. Yet, the administration hasn\u2019t arranged a single constructive conversation with American energy companies about strategies for unleashing American energy.\n\nThis week, Biden claimed, \"My administration has not stopped or slowed U.S. oil production.\" That\u2019s news to every American with a pulse. At every turn, this administration has chosen to undermine and impede American energy production. Biden has favored buying foreign oil over working with American companies here at home and has chosen short-term solutions, like depleting the SPR or pleading with OPEC, over long-lasting change.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe president clearly demonstrates that he and his administration reject the most basic economic principles. Simply put, flooding the market with artificial supplies reduces the price incentive for American producers to step in and provide relief for struggling Americans. After all, Biden made it abundantly clear that his administration will consider even more releases next year after the monster 180 million barrel release ends in December.\n\nAmerica has an abundance of energy-rich resources. We can supply our own energy, but Biden has turned off the tap. The Biden administration must admit his policies are failing the American people, unleash American energy production, and build the infrastructure our nation needs.

I fulfilled a campaign promise to create an Anti-Gang Unit within the Georgia Bureau of Investigation that has helped bring dozens of violent criminals to justice.

His decision, while rare, reflects the decision of other business owners like Alan Barnhart of Barnhart Crane.\n\nI experienced a similar decision-making process with my ownership of Hobby Lobby; I chose God.\n\nThe thought process reflects a basic competition of ideas that I think every business leader should reflect upon. What is the true source of your success?\n\nIn the mid-1980s I went through a period where I\u2019d grown proud thinking that I had the Midas touch \u2013 and I nearly lost the business. God had to show me that He was the one who granted success. The Bible says in Deuteronomy 8.18 that it\u2019s God who gives us the power to make wealth.\n\nPATAGONIA'S BILLIONAIRE FOUNDER PUTS HIS MONEY WHERE HIS MOUTH IS\n\nIn that vein, I\u2019d encourage every leader to consider their source of truth. What is the basis upon which they make decisions? Is it just themselves, or even a leadership team?\n\nFor me, my source of truth has always been prayer and the Bible. I truly believe that if leaders pray and seek truth from the Bible that their businesses will be revolutionized.\n\nFor instance, the Bible talks about giving a tithe or 10%. In fact, tithing is one of those areas where God specifically challenges us to give and see if he won\u2019t throw open the windows of blessing (Malachi 3:10). Can you imagine what would happen if every top leader in business became a tither? There would be literally billions available for good work around the world.\n\nAnother simple idea \u2013 the book of Proverbs in the Bible has 31 chapters \u2013 read a chapter a day to get wisdom beyond yourself.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest challenge is to ask the question of whether you are an owner or a steward \u2013 a manager of what you\u2019ve been entrusted with.\n\nMY LATE WIFE KIM TAUGHT ME HOW TO HONOR OUR LOVED ONES BY FOCUSING ON SOMETHING THAT WILL OUTLAST US\n\nAs an owner, there are certain rights and responsibilities, including the right to sell the company and keep the profits for yourself and your family. As our company grew, that idea began to bother me more and more. Well-meaning attorneys and accountants advised me to simply pass ownership down to my children and grandchildren. It didn\u2019t seem fair to me that I might change or even ruin the future of grandchildren who had not even been born yet.\n\nAs I considered my path, I realized that all my success had come from God. My wife, Barbara, and I had started this business with a $600 loan and I don\u2019t think anyone would have bet on us to become successful.\n\nBut from the very beginning our purpose was to honor God in all that we did. We worked hard and God gave the results. As we were blessed by God, we saw it as a great privilege to give back. We\u2019ve been able to provide hope through supporting ministries and planting churches all over the world.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThat bigger mission and purpose helped me realize that I was just a steward, a manager of what God had entrusted me. God was the true owner of my business.\n\nThat stewardship gave me a greater responsibility. I wasn\u2019t supposed to take the profits of the business and use them for myself. I also had a responsibility to the employees that God had put in my charge. This is why our company pays a minimum wage of $18.50 per hour, why we close on Sunday (which had been our most profitable day of business), and why we close by 8 p.m. every day.\n\nMore importantly, I was responsible for the mission and purpose of what I\u2019d been given. When I realized that I was just a steward, it was easy to give away my ownership.\n\nI think every CEO and business leader should consider whether they are owners or stewards. Consider the idea of where your success comes from. I\u2019ve seen many a business with the greatest of ideas not make it, and yet others with the simplest of ideas thrive. I believe that God is the one who grants success, and with it the responsibility to be a good manager.\n\nBest of all, when I made the decision to give away my ownership, similar to Patagonia\u2019s Yvon Chouinard, it allowed us to sustain our mission and purpose. It gives me a bigger purpose than just making money. Like Chouinard said, \"Instead of \u2018going public,\u2019 you could say we\u2019re \u2018going purpose.\u2019\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn Europe and other parts of the world there are businesses that have been in existence for more than 200 years. We tend to not think like that in the United States. It\u2019s made me think more and more about the idea of building a business to last 200 years \u2013 a business that would continue to honor God, reward employees with meaningful work and compensation, and be great contributors to hope and healing around the world.\n\nThe responsibility to steward that kind of culture is powerful. Truly, that is noble work."}, {"title": "Pelosi, Hoyer plead for House Dems to pony up cash to counter GOP fundraising juggernaut", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pelsoi-hoyer-plead-house-dems-pony-cash-gop-fundraising-juggernaut", "tag": "NANCY PELOSI", "content": "Top Democrats are pushing their members to donate more money to the party's official campaign arm to fight the significant fundraising advantage held by GOP-aligned groups ahead of Election Day.\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee, the chief campaign arm of the House GOP, started October with $92.3 million on hand compared to only $59.2 million for Democrats.\n\nThat edge, combined with a recent Fox News poll showing Republicans have overtaken Democrats on the generic congressional ballot among likely voters, has Democrats scrambling to come up with more money.\n\nThis week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer urged members to pay their dues to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC).\n\nHOUSE GOP CRUSHES DEMOCRATS IN DONATIONS AHEAD OF MIDTERMS, RAKING IN $73M\n\nHoyer, D-Md., sent a letter to House Democrats Thursday urging members in safe Democratic districts to pony up or risk losing the House.\n\n\"Having traveled to fifty-seven districts across twenty-six states so far this election cycle, I have seen the determination and energy of our frontline incumbents and red-to-blue candidates first hand,\" Hoyer wrote in the letter, a copy of which was reviewed by Fox News Digital. \"They can win, but only if they have the resources to do so.\"\n\nPelosi, D-Calif., is trying to incentivize members to do their part by pledging to match any dues that pour into the DCCC throughout October.

Record-high inflation has driven up the cost of everything from food to fuel, and our supply chain challenges show no sign of resolution. While some employers are struggling to find workers, others are preparing layoffs, and paychecks just aren\u2019t stretching as far as they used to.\n\nFamilies everywhere are questioning if they can afford everyday necessities, assuming they can find them on store shelves. For months families across the country have been dealing with these crises and instead of finding solutions, Democrats in Washington have added fuel to the fire by spending trillions we don\u2019t have.\n\nThe congressional districts we represent \u2013 Nebraska\u2019s 3rd and California\u2019s 48th \u2013 are very different in geography, size and demographics; but we hear many of the same worries from our constituents.

This is not too much to ask, but unfortunately feels out of reach for too many during these difficult and uncertain times.\n\nWe both opposed the Democrats\u2019 $750-billion so-called Inflation Reduction Act, which was signed into law by President Joe Biden in August. The act included many concerning policies, including $80 billion in new funding for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) \u2013 six times the agency\u2019s current budget.\n\nThere\u2019s no question the IRS is an agency in desperate need of reform and modernization, but the billions in the act will do little to get the IRS back on track. Of the $80 billion, only $3.2 billion is slated to go toward taxpayer services. New audits and enforcement? $45 billion, not counting the funding that would indirectly support audits by allowing for rulemaking and beefing up the budget in the Office of the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration.\n\nMany have suggested that the threat of 87,000 new IRS employees to help conduct these audits is a partisan conspiracy theory. We can assure you it is not. Previously released guidance from President Biden\u2019s Department of Treasury stated $80 billion in new funding would be utilized to hire some 87,000 employees.\n\nThe Treasury Department has said these wouldn\u2019t be new positions, and that they\u2019re planning to hire to make up for dwindling staffing numbers. If that\u2019s the case, why would extra funding be needed for existing staff positions? Ninety percent of Inflation Act funding going toward increasing and supporting audits to pay for Democrats\u2019 priorities and only 10% going toward customer service and IT modernization, it\u2019s clear what these employees will be hired to do.\n\nFurther, the administration says it's going to audit at the same rate they currently do, and 90% of audits right now are of taxpayers earning below $400,000. The administration has also specifically cited pass-through businesses with more than $200,000 in assets as entities they\u2019d want to audit.

They are finally connecting with voters on the issues they care most about \u2013 inflation, crime and immigration \u2013 while Democrats are essentially fighting a shadow midterm on issues voters care less about. Americans aren\u2019t necessarily acting out of partisanship; they\u2019re venting their frustration with the poor economic fundamentals and the threatened recession.\n\nIn the summer there was lot of speculation that the incumbent party could defy midterms history and escape a big loss, and I was puzzled by the large segment of Democratic voters who disapproved of President Joe Biden and yet were sticking with the Democratic Party in the midterms. That is beginning to crack now, especially when we look at likely voters which are breaking 53/47 in favor of the Republicans now.\n\nOn inflation, crime and immigration, Republicans are channeling voters\u2019 anxiety and frustration. In the Oct. 12-13 Harvard CAPS-Harris Poll, voters said those three issues were their greatest concern, and they were over 10 percentage points more likely to vote Republican than Democratic based on each. Among likely voters, that pro-GOP gap increases to 15 percentage points.\n\nWH PRESS SEC MOCKED FOR LINKING INFLATION RISE TO SPENDING BILL, SAYING RELIEF STARTS \u2018EARLY NEXT YEAR\u2019\n\nThis growing unpopularity of President Joe Biden\u2019s policies has been clear now for over a year and so the administration could have made a pivot, but instead it doubled down, even denying the issues around inflation (\"zero inflation\") and the border (\"no crisis\") existed at all.\n\nAmericans\u2019 anxiety around the economy looks devastating for the party in power. 84% of voters think the US is in a recession now or will be by next year. An astounding 57% of Americans think their personal financial situation is worsening. Even during most of the pandemic, only 20-30% said the same.\n\nVoters also blame Biden for these troubles. Fifty-five percnet of voters blame Biden for inflation, including 42% of Democrats. Unlike unemployment, which affects a sliver of the population, inflation affects all Americans, and they can easily see the effect on gas prices and grocery bills. The situation will only worsen as OPEC+\u2019s cut in oil production goes into effect, and the Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates yet again.\n\nThe Democrats are also avoiding confronting the other major issues, crime and immigration. Two-thirds of Americans think crime is rising, and 60% blame \"woke politicians\" for causing it.\n\nThe Republicans are pushing crime heavily in their ads, and yet the Democrats haven\u2019t acted. They could have passed a moderate-sponsored crime package that made important police reforms while increasing funding for the police too; but the left killed it.\n\nThe Democrats look indifferent on immigration too. Instead of acknowledging concerns over the rising number of migrants, neither Biden nor Vice President Kamala Harris, who is supposed to be in charge of the issue, have even gone to the border this year.\n\nThe Democrats cannot ignore how popular Republican stances on these issues are. An astounding 60% of Americans, including 64% of likely voters, say the Republican program of closing the border to illegal crossings, increasing incarceration of criminals and reducing or freezing government spending appeals to them.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nBiden has made popular moves in other areas, but student debt and marijuana will not bring enough new people to the polls. Fifty-eight percent of voters in the Harris Poll support his plan to cancel student debt, and 67% support his plan to pardon marijuana possession, but they are not translating to more support for the party. More voters say both these plans make them more likely to vote Republican rather than Democratic because the voters who oppose them are more energized. When it comes to student debt, for example, those who think they\u2019re going to have to pay for other people\u2019s relief are more motivated to vote than those getting the relief.\n\nThe impact of Dobbs on abortion, which provided the Democrats with much-needed momentum in the summer, has dissipated. Republican messaging on the issue has improved as candidates moved away from championing total bans, which remain deeply unpopular. While 40% of voters in the Harris Poll say the Supreme Court\u2019s reversal of Roe makes them more likely to vote Democratic, 37% now say it has made them more likely to vote Republican \u2013 up 5 points from last month. Democrats may have squandered their advantage by wasting time advocating for a controversial expansion of abortion rights, rather than for a bill that enshrined the rights allowed under Roe \u2013 which could likely have gained enough bipartisan support to pass.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 emphasis on January 6 and MAGA is also misguided. Biden\u2019s Philadelphia speech where he attacked MAGA Republicans and called them \"semi-fascists\" stopped his momentum and made him look like a divisive rather than uniting figure. The January 6 committee\u2019s multiple televised hearings have not shifted public opinion against Donald Trump either, and the Justice Department\u2019s ramped-up investigation has only revived his popularity.\n\nIt is not unusual for the party in power to lose seats in the midterms. Typically, they have passed some legislation that\u2019s unpopular as they pushed their presidential election majority to the limits of public approval. This election is different. Not only is there the typical buyer\u2019s remorse, but there are also big kitchen table issues producing an electorate that is overwhelming unhappy with the direction of the country and of their own lives \u2013 and that means voters facing issues like inflation and crime personally are far more likely to turn out to turn out the party in power."}, {"title": "JESSE WATTERS: Biden can't make, but he knows how to take", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/media/jesse-watters-biden-cant-make-knows-how-take", "tag": "FOX NEWS FLASH", "content": "Fox News host Jesse Watters accused President Biden of draining, draining, draining the country from everything from oil to food and weapons on \"Jesse Watters Primetime.\"\n\nJESSE WATTERS: \"Primetime\" launched an investigation into Joe Biden's new industrial revolution. $1,000,000,000,000, and a year later, and Biden's broken ground on one project: a heated sidewalk in a small New Hampshire town \u2014 and the project's not even close to finished, and it won't be before winter.

I saw a simple yard sign earlier this week that appropriately said \u2013 \"Fix Things, Vote Republican.\" That really said it all.\n\nAmerican voters seem to get this and the potential for a red wave is growing. Numerous recent polls suggest Republicans will easily retake control of the House of Representatives on Election Day next month. A Monmouth University poll released last week found that 47% of Americans want Republicans to lead Congress versus 44% who prefer Democrats. Republicans also have recently taken the lead in RealClearPolitics' Generic Congressional Vote survey, a somewhat rare event for the party.\n\nShould the election go as expected, GOP control of one or both houses of Congress will thankfully mark the beginning of the end of Biden's disastrous presidency. At the very least, Republicans can stop the reckless spending that has led to historic inflation, declining real wages, and negative economic growth. It will put a nail in the coffin of Democrats' radical legislative priorities. And it will allow Republicans to start bringing the economy out of recession and stagflation while laying the groundwork for meaningful legislative accomplishment and accelerated economic growth following the 2024 election.\n\nBIDEN DROVE 'HISTORICALLY' CLOSE MIDDLE EAST ALLIES INTO THE ARMS OF AMERICA'S GREATEST ENEMIES, EXPERTS SAY\n\nBut how much can Republicans do should they retake the House and/or the Senate in November? How will things be different?\n\nTo start with, Republicans can put a stop to the Democrats\u2019 partisan spending spree that began shortly after Biden took office and rapidly changed a V-shaped economic recovery into an economic downturn with inflation at levels not seen in 40 years. Former Clinton and Obama economists the likes of Larry Summers, Jason Furman and Steve Rattner all advised against this demand driving spending in a supply restrained economy (something about the law of supply and demand). Biden and his Democrat allies ignored them. But Republicans can put an end to further massive and destructive demand-driving spending sprees should they take at least one house of Congress \u2013 reversing runaway inflation and potentially staving off another Great Recession \u2013 or worse.\n\nRepublicans can also use their House appropriations power to roll back some of Biden's and his Democrat allies\u2019 worst policies. Exhibit A is Democrats' doubling of the IRS to send hither swarms of officers to harass small businesses and eat out their substance.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy promised Republicans' first bill of the new Congress would repeal this expansion. Such legislation won't become law as long as Biden is president. But as the Wall Street Journal reports this week, Republicans can still starve the IRS of the revenues needed to expand and wreak havoc by withholding funding in annual spending bills. This tactic could work in other areas where the Democrats have overreached since Biden took office.\n\nRepublicans can also use their oversight power to hold the Biden administration accountable. They can subpoena officials regarding wasteful spending, supply-chain turmoil, inflation and domestic energy restrictions \u2013 shining some light on Biden\u2019s obvious policy blunders. They can hold hearings on the politicization of the FBI and Department of Justice to get to the bottom of how these bodies became enforcement arms of the Democratic Party. A GOP House can also mercy kill the prime-time show trials known as the January 6 Committee.\n\n\"We\u2019re going to spend a lot of time in the first three, four months having investigation hearings and then we\u2019re going to be very active in the subcommittee process, focused on substantive waste, fraud and abuse type issues.,\" promised Rep. James Comer Jr. (R-Ky.) \"I'm going to bring the Oversight Committee back to what its original intent was.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nIf Republicans can win the Senate, they also can veto Biden's far-left administrative appointees and judicial nominees who serve as a rubber stamp on executive overreach. Biden will increasingly rely on executive orders such as his illegal $400-billion student loan bailout, so blocking activist judges who do his bidding is vital.\n\nA GOP-controlled Congress can also pass pro-growth legislation in an effort to strengthen the supply side of the law of supply and demand. The need for such legislation seems apparent to anyone who took a high school economics class (they call it the law of supply and demand for a reason), but it will have little chance of becoming law with Biden in office. Nonetheless, it will provide the American people with an effective governing alternative that can become reality in 2024 \u2013 if Republicans win the presidency.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Job Creators Network and Newt Gingrich recently released such a pro-growth governing playbook.

The middle class now receives only a scant 1-2% in interest on their eroding savings accounts, but they pay 7% for mortgages, while inflation eats away their value of their purchasing power at over 8% a year.\n\nAs part of the current cultural bewilderment, voters are baffled that the border patrol is overwhelmed while the administration hires 87,000 new IRS agents.\n\nThey cannot fathom why the FBI\u2019s Washington hierarchy has serially misled Congress and lied to federal investigators. Why would FBI agents monitor parents at school board meetings, or seek to humiliate the political enemies of the White House?\n\nSince when does the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff call his communist Chinese counterpart to warn him that his own American commander in chief is considered too unsteady?\n\nThe recent, unfiltered racist talk of Los Angeles city-council members, along with Kayne West\u2019s anti-Semitic outbursts, warn us that the ultimate manifestation of our premodern descent into tribalism, ethnic and racial chauvinism, and woke identity politics could soon be an abject nightmare like Rwanda or the former Yugoslavia.\n\nThe new woke cancel culture \u2014 so reminiscent of the Jacobins\u2019 reign of terror in revolutionary France, the Bolshevik takeover in 1918 Soviet Russia and Mao Zedong\u2019s cultural revolution \u2014 has turned the left into enemies of First-Amendment protected free speech and expression.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThe nightmares of George Orwell\u2019s dystopian novels \u2014 censorship, doxing, ostracism, Trotskization, statue-toppling, name-changing, historical erasure \u2014 have swept America, making the country unrecognizable to half the population.\n\nThe model would be similar to a postwar non-aligned Austria and Finland, or Western but neutral Switzerland. Kyiv then would not be a military threat to Russia, but more an asset than a liability to the West.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe result is that voters are worried about more than just their waning domestic and national security, their eroding economy, their unsafe streets, and wide-open borders. They fear they are also targeted by cultural revolutionaries who seek to wipe away the very foundational dates and documents of America \u2014 and demonize any who object to their cultural hijacking.\n\nSo do not be surprised about the looming counter-revolutionary pushback on November 8.

Now, new documents obtained by Fox News Digital reveal the parents featured in that meeting were primarily left-wing activists, including the head of a transgender-aligned group and others at organizations funded by Democratic megadonors.\n\nWalensky frequently touted that they had consulted parents' needs for the guidance despite her calendar containing the sole 30-minute meeting. American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten used the event to attack Fox News Digital and other publications for reporting on the CDC's closeness with teachers' unions. In May 2021, Weingarten tweeted a screenshot of a CDC email showing the event, saying the outlets \"are probably never going to let their readers know that the CDC met with parents too.\"\n\nThe parents who participated in the meeting, however, almost exclusively included a handful of liberal activists, according to the previously redacted emails obtained by Americans for Public Trust as part of their FOIA lawsuit against the CDC and shared with Fox News Digital.\n\nWalensky's private Feb. 10, 2021, roundtable featured five participants, including Roz Keith, the founder and executive director of Stand With Trans, an organization for parents of transgender children, the documents show.\n\nCDC DIRECTOR SPOKE WITH SEVERAL UNION LEADERS BEFORE TIGHTENING MASKING GUIDANCE, INTERNAL CALENDAR REVEALS\n\n\"We are committed to dismantling the barriers faced by our community based on racism, sexism, queer-antagonism, and other discriminatory factors,\" the group's website states. \"These barriers include recent legislation like denying trans people from using the bathroom of their gender, barring trans people from participating in sports of their gender, and banning schools from teaching about LGBTQ acceptance.\"\n\nKristin Rowe-Finkbeiner and Angelica Gonzalez also participated in the meeting. Rowe-Finkbeiner is the executive director of MomsRising, a progressive group that undertakes campaigns ranging from \"workplace justice\" to gun safety. Gonzalez, likewise, is affiliated with MomsRising, according to a tweet from the group.\n\nHeavyweight Democratic donors, meanwhile, finance the organization. MomsRising received $1 million each from George Soros' Open Society Policy Center and Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss' Berger Action Fund in 2020, according to grants.\n\nAnother participant in Walensky's closed press roundtable was Elena Hung, the president and co-founder of Little Lobbyists, which seeks \"to protect and expand the rights of children who have complex medical needs and disabilities through advocacy, education, and outreach.\"\n\nBIDEN ADMIN OPERATED WITH MISSING DATA AS CDC ISSUED PANDEMIC GUIDANCE, EMAILS SHOW\n\nHung is also a national co-chair of Health Care Voter, which holds politicians accountable for their votes on healthcare issues. The group is a project of the Sixteen Thirty Fund, a progressive nonprofit incubator at a massive liberal dark money network managed by Washington, the D.C.-based consulting firm Arabella Advisors.\n\nThe last parent on the call was Rachel Kobrin, a congregational rabbi.\n\n\"Since taking the reins of the CDC, Dr. Walensky has prioritized everything but following the science,\" Caitlin Sutherland, executive director of Americans for Public Trust, told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"First, she colluded with the teachers unions to keep our schools closed, and now we learn that her 'parent' meeting was nothing more than placating the demands of liberal activists from dark money groups,\" Sutherland said. \"Maybe if the CDC spent less time appeasing activists and unions, kids could have returned to school faster and wouldn't be facing devastating losses in learning.\"\n\nWHITE HOUSE CONSIDERED TEACHERS UNIONS' LABOR DISPUTES BEFORE RELEASING REOPENING GUIDANCE, EMAILS SHOW\n\nJason McDonald, Walensky's press secretary, told Fox News Digital that Walensky and other CDC scientists \"attended dozen of engagements with a diverse range of groups and advocacy organizations ahead of the release of the COVID-19 schools guidance.\"\n\n\"CDC experts met with parents at three, national PTA-hosted events on August 7, 2020, January 4, 2021, and February 12, 2021, where parents could ask CDC experts questions about the guidance and how to keep their children safe at school,\" he said, adding that their experts fielded \"17,276 calls and email messages from Americans asking about COVID-19 and schools between March 1, 2020, and February 11, 2021.\"\n\nDuring a Feb. 12, 2021, press briefing for the release of the school reopening guidelines, Walensky said they had considered the \"lived experiences, challenges, and perspectives\" of parents and worked \"to hear firsthand from parents.\" She also suggested guidance changes occurred due to \"sessions\" that included parents.\n\n\"The latest guidance is based on science and outreach with teachers, parents and the Department of Education,\" Walensky told NBC News. \"CDC officials conducted comprehensive reviews of literature and extensively studied what happened during school openings in the fall and in Europe,\" she said.\n\nWalensky also referred to the guidance as a \"long-needed roadmap\" that included input from parents, The 74 reported.\n\nHowever, Walensky's internal calendar indicates she had only conducted the sole parents meeting with the far-left activists, which occurred just two days before the release of the school guidance. The 30-minute Zoom session allowed each participant three minutes to \"introduce themselves and discuss their needs for safe school reopening,\" her calendar shows.\n\nWHITE HOUSE CONSIDERED TEACHERS UNIONS' LABOR DISPUTES BEFORE RELEASING REOPENING GUIDANCE, EMAILS SHOW\n\nThe American Federation of Teachers and Weingarten, who said Fox News Digital would probably never report on the parents' meeting, had instant access to Walensky and other high-level CDC officials. Teachers' unions also influenced last-minute changes to the school-reopening guidance, Fox News Digital previously reported.\n\nKelly Trautner, American Federation of Teachers' senior director of health issues, emailed Walensky a day before the CDC publicly posted the guidance. Within the email, she suggested the agency insert the line: \"In the event high-community transmission results from a new variant of SARS-CoV-2, a new update of these guidelines may be necessary.\"\n\nThe email led to a flurry of activity from high-ranking CDC officials. The next day - on the day the guidance was released to the public - CDC chief of staff Sherri Berger flagged Trautner's suggestion for \"possible follow-ups.\"\n\nMinutes later, Walensky forwarded the email to the CDC's director of preparedness and emerging infections, Henry Walke, who replied, \"Yes, will work with team.\"\n\nShortly after, Walke emailed Walensky with updated language for the guidance. \"Super, thank you for doing that,\" Walensky replied.\n\nCDC DIRECTOR DODGES QUESTIONS ON WHETHER COVID PANDEMIC IS OVER\n\nThe emails further revealed that the AFT and National Education Association, the country's largest teachers union, received a copy of the guidance before the CDC made it public. The CDC's then-acting associate director for communications, Christopher Jones, also messaged Weingarten and Becky Pringle, NEA's president, thanking them for their continued partnership and input.\n\nThe New York Post also reported on emails from Americans for Public Trust showing coordination between the Biden White House and the influential teachers' unions on school reopenings.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn at least two instances, suggestions offered by the AFT were \"adopted nearly verbatim\" in the final text of a CDC document on reopening guidance, the Post reported.\n\nThe Biden administration later tightened school masking guidelines in May 2021 following threats from teachers' unions, Fox News Digital previously reported."}, {"title": "Inflation is busting bank accounts across America.

But he may have to force it through parliament, which would damage his democratic credentials and further enrage those who are opposing it.\n\nFrance's trade unions have called for an eighth round of nationwide protests on Wednesday. On the same day, the bill heads to a committee of seven senators and seven lower-house lawmakers as part of the complex legislative process. Open-ended strikes have been disrupting some refineries, train traffic across the country and garbage collection in Paris.\n\nFRENCH PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON INSISTS PENSION REFORM IS NEEDED AS MILLIONS CONTINUE TO STRIKE\n\nIn a letter last week to unions, Macron reiterated his views, insisting on the need for raising the retirement age in order to make the French pension system financially sustainable in the coming years.\n\nIf the parliamentary committee reaches an accord on Wednesday, the text is expected to be submitted to a vote in both the Senate and the National Assembly the next day. However, the outcome in the lower house, where Macron\u2019s centrist alliance lost its majority last year, is hard to predict.\n\nIf the government considers the risk too high that the bill would be rejected, it could use a special constitutional power that would force the pension reform through without a vote.\n\nAccording to political analyst Brice Teinturier, deputy director-general of the Ipsos polling institute, such a move \"would appear as brutal and would increase people\u2019s sense that it is an unfair measure imposed from above.\"\n\nThe government acknowledged a vote is the favored option, because it would provide more legitimacy to the pension plan.\n\nOpinion polls show that a majority of people oppose the reform, and at the same time that they \"have in mind the idea that ... Macron will pass his law, whatever it costs,\" Teinturier stressed. \"Yet it doesn\u2019t mean that they are resigned \u2026 The resentment and anger remain intact.\"\n\nThe use of the constitutional power would trigger a no-confidence motion. In a scenario that appears unlikely at this stage, but has been raised by some government officials, it could ultimately lead Macron to dissolve the National Assembly and call new legislative elections.\n\nMacron \"considers \u2014 rightly or wrongly \u2014 that if he doesn\u2019t do that reform, he won\u2019t be able to do any reform anymore,\" Teinturier said.\n\nThe French president has pushed his economic agenda through since he was first elected in 2017 on a promise to make the country's economy more competitive, including by making people work longer. He made the pension reform a flagship of his second \u2014 and final \u2014 term after his reelection last year.\n\nChanges he made in previous years include making it easier to hire and fire workers, cutting business taxes and making it more difficult for the unemployed to claim benefits.\n\nThe government plans to present a bill in the coming months aimed at bringing the unemployment rate down to around 5% \u2014 one of Macron\u2019s commitments. France's unemployment rate recently reached 7.2%, its lowest rate since 2008.\n\nMacron and government officials are mindful of the yellow vest protests, when violent riots broke out at the end of 2018 and later turned into a broader denunciation of social injustice.\n\nThe situation appears different this year, with unions jointly organizing the protest movement in largely peaceful demonstrations.\n\nUnions have vowed to further increase the pressure on the government. Yet they have stopped short, until now, to call for an open-ended general strike.\n\nFrench economist Thomas Piketty strongly criticized the pension plan, saying it \"simply aims to raise money, without any objective of universality or simplification.\"\n\nFRENCH WORKERS CONTINUE TO HOLD STRIKES AGAINST MACRON'S PENSION REFORM PLAN\n\n\"The urgent need is for investment in education and health and the establishment of a fairer economic system, in France and in Europe, and even more so on an international scale.

His reputation has reached European shores, and his successful governance has piqued the interest of many. Leaders throughout the old Continent are already turning to what he has accomplished in the Sunshine state as a blueprint for Europe.\n\nSupply side economic principles have once again turned out to be a recipe for success in Florida, just as they had been during the Reagan administration. Tax cuts, deregulation, balanced budgets, incentives to invest, hire and produce have resulted in an unemployment rate of 2.5 percent as of December 2022, the lowest since 2006, a labor force growth of 3.5 percent (more than double the American national growth rate) and an increase in the overall population. Freedom, prosperity and expanded opportunities are the natural consequences of the traditional conservative policies that President Ronald Reagan brought into the mainstream, empowering individuals, and families to fight for what they believe in \u2013 their customs, traditions and communities.\n\nOn the cultural side, he has not shied away from fighting against a new reincarnation of the old foe of civilization \u2013 communism. Wokeism and cancel culture are two notions that do not manifest in society as a need of the many, but rather an imposition of the few for political and financial gains. In front of this top-down forceful imposition, the silent majority remains often alone. Few are the leaders who stand up to what constitutes as madness.\n\nThe left, throughout its history, has tried in various forms to segregate people into groups antagonistic with one another, and impose upon them the necessity to turn to the state for salvation. By presenting the governmental machine as the only entity capable of keeping a society together, the left increases its powers and influence immensely, effectively controlling many aspects of everyday life. The right on the other hand lets the wisdom accumulated over centuries, tradition, family and community guide the individual, instead of the state.\n\nDESANTIS TOUTS ACCOMPLISHMENTS, PAVES WAY FOR FUTURE IN STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS\n\nBy exposing this modus operandi of the left, Governor DeSantis has shown ideological clarity, discipline and immense political will. Historians and unbiased observers noticed the same traits in President Reagan\u2019s fight against communism. It is exactly this fusion between supply side economics and cultural common sense that is the key to his success.\n\nIn Europe, we can distinguish and appreciate the Florida model better, because the economic model of the European Union suffers from the opposite policies applied in the Sunshine state. I have highlighted on many occasions that Europe has been laid low by a heady brew of bureaucracy, over-regulation, over-taxation and debt. A crisis of political leadership has in turn produced a deficiency of bold, innovative ideas, a shortage of vision and a huge expansion of government intervention.\n\nThe entire EU economic model is based on cheap energy obtained from Russia, and low input costs used to create high-quality products exported to the world. This model was aided by extremely and unnaturally low interest rates, which had the effect of increasing structural imbalances and debt, while the tax burden remains elevated and the economy as a whole centralized.\n\nIn all effects, Europeans have become addicted to government and Quantitative Easing, with individual freedoms at the mercy of bureaucrats, who have the same propensity as their American counterparts to enforce wokeism, cancel culture, and green policies for which our economies are not ready.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nGovernment interventions and Keynesianism produce only secular stagnation and erosion of individual freedoms, as we are seeing federally in the United States with trillions of dollars in packages approved by Congress that are not translated in growth or new jobs. The same was observed during the Obama administration, which ended with a one percent growth rate, while the following administration\u2019s supply side policies produced the best economy in decades, and at the supposed end of an expansionary period.\n\nIn Europe, between 2014 and 2019, the Juncker Plan involved \u20ac439 billion on investment projects. The return on that huge debt financed package was a mediocre +0.9 percent uptick in the bloc\u2019s GDP and just 1.1 million extra jobs. Currently, the EU is plagued by stagnant wages, slow growth, and inflexible labor markets.\n\nThe Florida model applied in large scale in the United States would give the world\u2019s superpower a much-needed boost economically and socially and perhaps could serve as an incentive for Europe to reverse its declining path and ensure the balance of power remains in the West for decades to come.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM NIKOLA KEDHI"}, {"title": "Miami police arrest 5 suspects after officer wounded in shooting", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/miami-police-arrest-5-suspects-officer-wounded-shooting", "tag": "FLORIDA", "content": "Police in Miami said five suspects were taken into custody in connection with a shooting that wounded an officer on Wednesday.\n\nMiami-Dade Police Director Alfredo Ramirez told WTVJ-TV that the officer was conducting a narcotics investigation around 4 p.m. near the 500 block of Northwest 42nd Street and was \"ambushed\" from behind while approaching another suspect he intended to arrest.\n\nThe shot grazed the officer, who was treated and released from Jackson Memorial Hospital, Ramirez said.\n\nA 32-year-old man was accused of being the gunman and was expected to be charged with attempted murder of a law enforcement officer with a firearm.

Loans will be handed out like candy if his words are true.\n\nFor now, it seems, Russia can pay for its war, so far boosted by its oil revenues. Energy prices rose in 2022. Russia raked in over $200 billion for it last year. Through various schemes, however, a significant amount of petrol revenue is landing in the private sector. A mere detail, Mironenko says. He said the state is already shaking companies down for some of their profits to help with the bottom line. And those companies are in no position to decline.\n\nBut Russia\u2019s budget deficit is growing in recent months \u2014 \"whopping\" was the word Mironenko used in our conversation. But its reserves remain large to the tune of at least $120 billion and public debt is low, he says.\n\nBut there are two sides to every kopek, and there are cracks in the edifice. Putin claims Russia\u2019s relative economic success during trying circumstances is not down to printing money, but Mironenko says the treasury effectively is doing that while cleverly keeping it from flowing too quickly into the economy to further drive prices up.\n\nThe Russian president also made a big deal about record unemployment, which Mironenko points out is actually a problem when you consider it has a lot to do with the massive brain drain caused by the war. Conservatively, 500,000 to 700,000 Russians have left since February 2022. Some suggest it\u2019s more like a million.\n\n\"The recent emigration was of highly educated and professional people, and it will create enormous problems for the labor market,\" Mironenko says. \"It is very tight. There was also a loss of manpower due to mobilization. So, employers are having real trouble finding people.\"\n\nSENIOR RUSSIAN OFFICIAL THREATENS POLISH BORDERS AS MOSCOW MOUNTS AGGRESSION AGAINST OTHER EUROPEAN NATIONS\n\nMironenko says that there are supply chain problems and cites massive delays recently in the issuing of biometric passports because there is just one factory in Russia that produces the chips they require. Before the war, Russia could outsource some of the production, but no more. Imported consumer goods, however, are still finding their way in.\n\nSanctions, it seems, will take a bit more time to have a real and visible impact on Russia.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"They didn\u2019t destroy the Russian economy at once but have put it on a path of long and slow stagnation,\" Mironenko said. \"We have this figure of minus 3% growth in 2022, but the GDP was expected to rise by 3%.\n\n\"So, we are actually talking about a difference of 6% and not minus 3. And if you have ten years of economic growth or decline like this when the world economy is rising by 3 or 4% a year, this would put Russia into a bad state.

The Biden administration has leased 1.7 million offshore acres for oil and gas in its first two years, fewer than any president since President Richard Nixon and about a third seen in President Barack Obama\u2019s first two years, according to the American Petroleum Institute (API).\n\nThat statistic shows how effectively the Biden administration has been at keeping Biden\u2019s promise to dramatically shut down new oil and gas drilling. As a candidate, Biden famously promised \"no more drilling on federal lands, no more drilling, including offshore.\"\n\nFOSSIL FUEL PROFITS ARE VITAL FOR GREEN ENERGY PROJECTS DEMS ROUTINELY TOUT\n\nBut while offshore oil and gas leases have sputtered under Biden, his administration is hoping to make up the difference with its latest offshore wind sale.

It said the Gulf of Mexico lease sale will auction three sites off the coast of Galveston, Texas, and Lake Charles, Louisiana.\n\nBIDEN ADMIN WEIGHS COMPLETE BLOCK ON OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING AS GAS PRICES KEEP RISING\n\nThe department said several environmental and \"equity\" considerations will be considered by Interior as it considers lease proposals. For example, Interior said it will take into account Biden\u2019s executive order on \"Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government\" as it conducts its wind lease auctions.\n\nInterior is \"considering lease stipulations to ensure that communities, particularly underserved communities, are considered and engaged with early and often throughout the offshore wind energy development process, that potential impacts and benefits from lessees\u2019 projects are documented, and lessees\u2019 project proposals are informed by or altered to address those impacts and benefits.\"\n\nThe government will also require companies to contribute to a fisheries compensatory mitigation fund to redress \"potential negative impacts to commercial and for-hire recreational fishers caused by offshore wind development in the Gulf of Mexico.\"\n\nIt will also require lessees to summarize their \"engagement with Tribes and ocean users potentially affected by proposed offshore wind activities.\"\n\nRISING GAS PRICES FUEL SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS AS BIDEN ADMIN ASKS FOR VENEZUELA'S HELP: 'VERY FRUSTRATING'\n\nIn his first two years in office, the only offshore oil and gas lease sales that have taken place under Biden have been those ordered by Congress or the courts. And late last year, the Biden administration allowed the federal government\u2019s five-year plan for offshore oil and gas leasing to expire for the first time in history, a lapse that will make new offshore leases difficult until a new plan is in place.\n\nAPI argues that the oil and gas industry needs time in advance to scout sites and search for energy reserves in the Gulf and elsewhere, that Biden\u2019s slowdown in offshore lease sales for oil and gas is creating massive uncertainty in the industry and potential energy supply problems down the road.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"A lapse in the federal offshore leasing program could jeopardize American energy security, cost thousands of jobs, and risk billions in lost federal, state and local revenues, according to analysis prepared by Energy and Industrial Advisory Partners,\" API Senior Vice President for Communications Megan Bloomgren wrote this month."}, {"title": "Saudi Arabia invests $1B in Yemen's central bank", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/saudi-arabia-invests-1b-yemens-central-bank", "tag": "SAUDI ARABIA", "content": "Saudi Arabia deposited $1 billion into the central bank of Yemen\u2019s internationally recognized government Tuesday in a bid to bolster the country\u2019s ailing economy, state media said.\n\nIn a brief statement, the state-run Saudi Press Agency said the $1 billion deposited into the Aden-based central bank will help the Riyadh-backed administration implement economic reforms.\n\nYemen\u2019s ruinous civil war, now entering its ninth year, has wrecked the country\u2019s economy and pushed half of the population to the brink of famine.

Since taking office, President Biden has unveiled programs curbing fossil fuel production, boosting green energy alternatives and implementing roadblocks for traditional energy infrastructure projects like pipelines.\n\nHowever, Republicans and industry groups have blasted Biden's agenda for pushing the technology that is largely manufactured in China. China accounts for about 80% of the world's solar panel production and the majority of the mining and processing of critical minerals vital for electric vehicle (EV) batteries, wind turbines and industrial battery storage facilities.\n\n\"Americans deserve to know why their taxpayer dollars are being used to fund companies, like Microvast, with deep ties to China,\" McMorris Rodgers continued. \"Nothing is off the table. We have a lot of questions for the Biden administration.\"\n\nIn October, the Department of Energy (DOE) awarded a $200 million grant to Microvast, a Texas-based maker of a key component of EV batteries, under the $1 trillion infrastructure package Biden signed into law in November 2021.\n\nWhile the DOE noted the company was headquartered in Texas, it failed to mention that Microvast's subsidiary is based in Huzhou, China, and that the company produces the battery components in China. Microvast also reported in its most recent financial filings that 69% of its revenue was generated in China and just 3% came from the U.S.\n\nMeanwhile, Microvast acknowledged in the same filings that the Chinese government \"exerts substantial influence\" over its business activities and \"may intervene at any time and with no notice.\"\n\nFollowing reports about Microvast's deep ties to China, McMorris Rodgers and Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Va., the ranking member of the Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, wrote a letter to Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, requesting a briefing on the matter.\n\nGREEN GROUP INFLUENCING BIDEN ADMIN HAS DEEP TIES TO CHINESE GOVERNMENT\n\n\"We're going to have to get answers from DOE in relationship to their grant programs. We've got to double-check and see what they're doing on their vetting because Microvast has made no secret that they are a Chinese-owned company,\" Griffith said in an interview with Fox News Digital.\n\n\"We don't want Chinese companies using American money to create additional Chinese jobs and Chinese technology and Chinese wealth, even if some of those jobs are in the United States,\" he continued. \"We have to be very careful, we have to do oversight on that, we have to examine everything that's going on and we're going to have to bring in the officials to explain exactly what they're doing.\"\n\nCommittee Republicans have repeatedly sounded the alarm that the Biden administration's climate policies are favoring China.\n\nFor example, they have warned that EV mandates would benefit Chinese companies most, noted that China dominates the global supply chains for the critical minerals in solar panels and electric vehicles, and criticized the Biden administration for looking the other way on U.S. tariff violations committed by Chinese companies.

The scene could be likened to that of a young subordinate who just saw his boss and hurried his pace to welcome him, while the boss looked down his nose at the young upstart.\n\nBIDEN MEETS CHINA'S XI JINPING AT G-20 SUMMIT IN INDONESIA, RAISES US CONCERNS ABOUT TAIWAN, HONG KONG, PUTIN\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say that the scene revealed much about the two men and our emergent relations as global powers. Xi has just came from the 20th Chinese Communist Party Congress which granted him an unprecedented third term as chairman, making him the most powerful Chinese leader since Chairman Mao Zedong. Xi intends to aggressively press toward his goal of world dominance and as he told the 20th Congress, \"the East [China] is rising while the West [the U.S.] is declining.\"\n\nBy comparison, Biden came to the Xi meeting weakened by the likely loss of his party\u2019s majority in the U.S. House of Representatives and a host of troubling issues at home including a deeply divided citizenry and a military arguably in decline.\n\nBesides the optics at the summit, what Biden said at the post-meeting press conference on Monday evening demonstrates his priorities and failure to truly understand the Chinese leadership\u2019s intentions.\n\nBiden claimed his conversations with President Xi were \"open and candid\" and his \"intentions and priorities\" were made clear to the dictator.\n\nPUTIN TO SKIP INDONESIA G-20 SUMMIT DUE TO ASSASSINATION FEAR: REPORT\n\nFurther, he indicated that he told Xi that he \"would defend American values, human rights and compete vigorously,\" and he promised the communist leader that America\u2019s China policy hasn\u2019t changed regarding the issue of Taiwan\u2019s status.\n\nBiden failed to mention whether he pressed the Chinese leader on important issues such as the regime\u2019s maligned economic behaviors like its failure to abide by trade agreements, its military aggression in the South China Sea, the supply of precursors used to make fentanyl which annually kills tens of thousands of Americans, the origins of COVID, the rampant stealing of our intellectual property, and whether it will dial back on its well-documented human rights violations.\n\nThe president allowed only four questions after his remarks at the press briefing. He was asked whether a Cold War with China is avoidable. \"There need not be a new cold war\" with China, said Biden. Rather, we are in \"competition\" with China. That response ignores the contrary history of \"unrestricted warfare\" China is waging against the West using all Chinese instruments of power such as economic, military, ideological, geopolitical and technological.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nOn the issue of Taiwan, which Beijing considers a breakaway province, Biden said he does not anticipate \"any imminent attempt on the part of China to invade Taiwan,\" even though two weeks ago President Xi vowed to \"reunify\" the mainland with Taiwan and he would \"never promise to renounce the use of force.\"\n\nBiden said he \"made it clear\" to President Xi that our Taiwan policy \"has not changed at all.\" Yet, on multiple occasions over the past two years, the president confused that policy by promising to defend Taiwan against any communist assault. Yet, Biden insisted that Xi \"understood exactly what I was saying.\"\n\nPerhaps most distressing is the president\u2019s promise to set up more meetings with Chinese officials to discuss our differences.

The communist nation ended its one-child policy in 2015 and has since resulted in a surplus of an estimated 34 million men, as many families preferred to have a son over a daughter.

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres downplayed the agreement and paved the way for COP27.\n\n\"It's an important step, but it's not enough,\" he said at the time. \"It's time to go into emergency mode.\"\n\nGroups, including Greenpeace International, similarly criticized the agreement, calling it a \"polite request.\"\n\nUN BRUSHES OFF CONCERNS ABOUT UPCOMING CLIMATE SUMMIT'S 'HUGE CARBON FOOTPRINT'\n\nAhead of this year's summit, which is scheduled to begin Monday and conclude on Nov. 18, high-ranking officials in the U.S. and other Western nations have reiterated the importance of solving global warming, which they characterized as the biggest threat facing humanity.\n\n\"Among all of the centrifugal forces of these last 20 years, all vying to pull the world apart in many ways, the climate crisis still looms largest as the issue that will change life unalterably. Now, that may sound grandiose, but it is no exaggeration,\" Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry, who will lead the American delegation at the event, said in October.\n\n\"Existential means existential. It demands that we all work together, because no country can resolve this crisis by itself,\" he continued. \"So it\u2019s especially appropriate to be here, just 12 days before the gavel is going to come down at the COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh \u2013 and with it, a major accountability moment on this urgent issue.\"\n\nJOHN KERRY WILL FLY COMMERCIAL TO UN CLIMATE CONFERENCE FOLLOWING BACKLASH FOR PRIVATE JET CARBON EMISSIONS\n\nKerry added that nations must \"repair the planet at the pace that science demands\" and increase the ability to adapt to cataclysmic global warming.\n\nAmong the conference's main objectives will be to forward solutions that cut carbon emissions and limiting global warming to just 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The world has already warmed about one degree above pre-industrial levels, according to the U.N.\n\n\"I have no expectations for COP27 whatsoever because there's been 27 of these meetings and they haven't solved climate change in any one of them,\" Anthony Watts, a senior fellow for environment and climate at The Heartland Institute, told Fox News Digital in an interview. \"This is literally nothing more than a trade show.\"\n\n\"Even with the Paris accords in 2015 \u2013 they supposedly came up with a breakthrough,\" Watts added. \"Well, that breakthrough will amount to just a few hundredths of a degree of temperature drop by 2100 if everyone complies with the promises they've made and the thing is entirely voluntary. It's entirely just show and trade craft. There's no real things being accomplished here.\"\n\nJUDICIAL WATCH SUES BIDEN ADMIN OVER JOHN KERRY'S TRAVEL COSTS, CALENDAR, STAFFER INFO\n\nSteve Milloy, a senior legal fellow at the Energy & Environment Legal Institute, noted that the U.N. has itself projected carbon emissions will increase by at least 10% by 2030, suggesting previous pledges have been relatively ineffective.\n\n\"Even if you do believe that emissions are going to destroy the world, nobody's really doing anything about it,\" he told Fox News Digital in an interview. \"So, the whole thing is just pointless.\"\n\nAnother priority of the conference will be to hash out additional climate finance agreements enabling developing nations to pay for complex renewable energy technologies and clean energy development. Western nations have fallen far short of a 2009 U.N. pledge to give $100 billion a year to poor countries for climate mitigation through 2025.\n\nAlthough the Trump administration backed out of climate finance agreements, President Biden has pledged more than $11 billion per year to the developing world for climate mitigation.\n\nA group of African and Arab countries have banded together to form the so-called COP27 Coalition ahead of the conference to issue a series of demands for wealthy nations. Among the demands, the coalition said the West should \"provide finance, technology and capacity to developing countries.\"\n\nBIDEN PLEDGES TO MOBILIZE PRESIDENCY TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE: 'CODE RED FOR HUMANITY'\n\n\"We're telling developing nations that we don't want them to go through the process of developing, we don't want them to have coal or natural gas or even nuclear,\" Daniel Turner, the executive director of Power The Future, told Fox News Digital in an interview. \"We want them to use wind and solar, which is intermittent, which is ineffective, which is incredibly cost prohibitive.\"\n\n\"Along with climate financing is a lot of energy poverty and we're very comfortable plunging certain sectors of the world, even certain sectors of the American population, into energy poverty,\" he said.\n\nOverall, the two-week summit is expected to welcome about 40,000 participants \u2013 including 24,000 diplomats and 13,000 observers \u2013 matching last year's total, according to the U.N.\n\nIn addition to Kerry, President Biden and several top administration officials are expected to travel to Egypt for the conference. And U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak reversed his decision not to attend COP27, saying climate action was essential to long-term prosperity and energy security.\n\nHowever, China and India, two of the world's largest emitters, are expected to send a slimmed-down delegation compared to past conferences, calling into doubt whether any agreement reached could have a significant impact. China accounts for about 27% of total global emissions \u2013 nearly tripling the total in the U.S., the world's second-largest emitter, according to Rhodium Group \u2013 and continues to approve and construct a large amount of coal power plants.\n\nCHINA HALTS MILITARY, CLIMATE TALKS WITH US IN RETALIATION FOR PELOSI VISIT\n\n\"That should be the first priority, or the maybe the first agenda item at the conference. If climate is a global issue and two of the world's largest emitters are not participating, then all the rest of our reductions, or our pledges, are absolutely meaningless,\" Turner said.\n\n\"China is bringing more coal online. They're bringing more coal online than we currently have in the United States,\" he continued. \"Why would America make any efforts to cut something like coal, when it's being completely offset, or exacerbated, by what China's doing?\"\n\nIn recent months, European consumers and businesses have been hit with massive energy bills due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which upended global oil and gas markets due to Russian producers' dominance, and an aggressive transition to green energy sources like wind and solar pushed by several major European nations.\n\nAmid the crisis, Europeans have been forced to take drastic measures to conserve energy and keep bills low while governments have imposed rationing rules and introduced relief programs.\n\nIn the U.S., energy prices have surged due to a similar crisis. Home heating costs alone are expected to rise another 17.8% this winter compared to last year.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"The green agenda is a kind of cult-like, quasi-religious movement,\" Benny Peiser, the director of the London-based Global Warming Policy Foundation, told Fox News Digital. \"They will go as long as governments push that agenda and there's no indication in Europe or in the U.S. currently, that this is going to go away.\"\n\n\"There is, of course, a growing realization that the energy policies in Europe over the last 20 to 30 years have been an utter disaster,\" he added. \"But are our governments, our ministers, going to acknowledge that and say, 'Sorry, we've got it wrong'? No.\""}, {"title": "Man who shot 2 US Marshals during a standoff in Tennessee sentenced to 40 years in prison", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/man-shot-2-us-marshals-during-standoff-tennessee-sentenced-40-years-prison", "tag": "TENNESSEE", "content": "A man has been sentenced to 40 years in federal prison for shooting two deputy U.S. Marshals during a standoff at a duplex in West Tennessee, prosecutors said.\n\nBobby Joe Claybrook Jr., 41, had pleaded guilty to assault on a federal officer with a deadly weapon and discharging a weapon during a violent crime stemming from a November 2020 shooting, the U.S. attorney's office said in a Tuesday news release announcing the sentence.\n\nAuthorities said federal agents and local law enforcement went to a duplex in Jackson to serve arrest warrants for Claybrook on attempted homicide and weapons charges.\n\n2 PEOPLE FATALLY SHOT IN CHATTANOOGA, TENNESSEE\n\nBefore the agents knocked on the door, Claybrook fired on the team through a small porch window.

Brian Kemp, R-Ga., told Fox News Digital why he believes he's the best candidate for Georgia and gives his thoughts on his Democratic opponent Stacey Abrams.\n\nWhat is your closing message to voters?\n\nKemp: Georgia voters have a clear choice to make in this election. When I was campaigning for governor in 2018, I told Georgians I would fight hard every single day to put them first ahead of the status quo, whether they voted for me or not. Together, we\u2019ve created the lowest unemployment rate in our state\u2019s history, three straight years of record economic development in communities large and small, and \u2014 because we reopened first \u2014 we\u2019ve used record surplus funds to put money back in Georgians\u2019 pockets as they fight through 40-year-high inflation. Stacey Abrams has said she thinks Georgia is the \"worst state in the country to live.\" My family and I disagree. We believe Georgia is the best place to live, work, and raise a family, and we are asking for Georgians\u2019 votes to keep it that way.\n\nWhat do you think is the most important issue to voters in Georgia?\n\nKemp: As I travel the state and listen to voters, the issue that continues to be at the top of everyday Georgians\u2019 lists is inflation and the rising costs of living. Georgians are facing the consequences of 40-year-high inflation caused by failed policies and Democratic leadership in Washington. In Georgia, we\u2019ve been able to provide inflation relief through tax refunds, the largest income tax cut in Georgia history, and suspending the gas tax to fight rising prices at the pump. While Stacey Abrams celebrates the disastrous Biden agenda, I\u2019ll keep fighting to create real economic relief for Georgia families.\n\nPOLLS SHOW REPUBLICANS FLIP KEY METRIC IN 2022 MIDTERM ELECTIONS, DEMOCRATS \u2018BLEW THEIR LEAD\u2019\n\nA majority of Georgia voters view the economy as a top concern this election cycle, what would you do to combat record inflation?\n\nKemp: I\u2019ve been working nonstop to help alleviate the pain Georgians are feeling due to record 40-year-high inflation caused by the disastrous policies of the Biden Administration. Thankfully, under our administration, we re-opened Georgia first and were able to use the record revenues to help Georgians fight rising costs with a $1 billion tax refund, the largest income tax cut in Georgia history, and by suspending the gas tax since March. If I am re-elected, I will continue working with the General Assembly to enact inflation relief through another $1 billion tax refund and a property tax rebate that will save the average Georgian 15 to 25 percent on their property taxes. We can't fix everything Washington has broken, but I will continue doing my part as governor to put more money back into hardworking Georgians' pockets to help them face the Democrat-created economic crisis.\n\nWhat limitations, if any, do you support on abortion?\n\nKemp: I support the current state law that bans abortions after the detection of a fetal heartbeat. The law contains exceptions for the life of the mother, medically futile pregnancies, rape and incest.\n\nDEMS WORRIED ABOUT CRUCIAL MIDTERM PICKUPS AFTER DSCC, SENATE MAJORITY PAC'S LACK OF INVOLVEMENT IN KEY RACES\n\nHow would you combat rising crime in Georgia? Would you support cashless bail, if elected?\n\nKemp: Since elected, I\u2019ve stayed laser-focused on keeping Georgians safe. In my first four years as governor, I prioritized cracking down on criminal street gangs and street racing, tackling violent crime, and passing legislation to toughen penalties for human traffickers. I fulfilled a campaign promise to create an Anti-Gang Unit within the Georgia Bureau of Investigation that has helped bring dozens of violent criminals to justice. Additionally, I signed legislation that instituted a $5,000 pay raise to all state law enforcement professionals, and created a state law enforcement Crime Suppression Unit to address rising crime in our capital city.\n\nIf elected to a second term, I\u2019ll continue building on the successes of my first term by increasing penalties for gang recruitment of minors, implementing a database for gang research and prevention, reforming the \"own recognizance\" bond system, creating an education loan reimbursement program for those looking to become POST-certified members of Georgia\u2019s law enforcement community and medical examiners, and ensuring specific places of business adhere to state law regarding notification of human trafficking resources. While my opponent champions soft-on-crime policies like defunding the police and eliminating cash bail, I will continue to stand with law enforcement to keep Georgia families safe.\n\nWill you accept the results of this year's election?\n\nKemp: Yes.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhat is one thing you admire about your opponent?\n\nKemp: Stacey Abrams and her allies have put in a lot of work to build a formidable ground game in our state. That's why it's critical that Republicans continue working to strengthen our ground game and amplify our message.

But do you know why it\u2019s controversial?\n\nIf you haven\u2019t researched asset management, the answer is probably no.\n\nThe role of asset managers is to invest people\u2019s money \u2013 their assets \u2013 in mutual funds, securities or exchange-traded funds that yield good returns. Why would you entrust an investor with your money if not for the expectation that its investment on your behalf will appreciate in value or generate income?\n\nUnder this arrangement, the asset manager isn\u2019t the beneficiary of the holdings it manages. You are. The asset manager has a fiduciary duty to you \u2013 and must act with good faith, candor and heightened caution \u2013 because it controls your money. It\u2019s unethical to use someone\u2019s money in ways he or she doesn\u2019t like, or in ways he or she doesn\u2019t agree to. Individuals, by contrast, are free to indulge ESG goals when investing their own money.\n\nWOKE WALL STREET IS IN FOR A RECKONING\n\nThese are basic principles \u2013 yet many asset managers and mutual funds seem to have forgotten, ignored or neglected them.\n\nMany investment companies have used ESG criteria to screen corporations for inclusion or exclusion. Rather than investing assets where they will yield the most returns, or on the basis of financial performance, these investment companies invest assets in funds consisting of corporations that meet certain ESG criteria. Under the guise of stewardship, they\u2019re expanding their fiduciary responsibilities to include climate change and using their proxy power to strongarm companies at the board level.\n\nTwo problems: First, corporations easily game the system, figuring out how to meet the ESG criteria and improve their public image and reputation without actual commitments to any one of the three ESG prongs; second, the investment companies are mismanaging people\u2019s money and leveraging their proxy power to intimidate company boards.\n\nTop executives and board members at major asset management companies have done a great disservice to investors by pursuing ESG objectives over fiduciary duties. Large investment companies have gotten wealthy investing state pension money in underperforming ESG funds \u2013 at the expense of the beneficiaries. To the extent that public pension fund managers are responsible for this situation, they have vastly increased risks to taxpayers who could be expected to bail out these funds if they fall short of the returns necessary to pay retirees.\n\nFORMER BLACKROCK EXECUTIVE ARGUES ESG IS BAD FOR SOCIETY AND YOUR WALLET IN WSJ OP-ED\n\nTo make matters worse, the biggest asset managers \u2013 companies like BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street \u2013 have gained voting rights in publicly traded companies and are pushing those companies into \"wokeness.\" Rather than divesting from the corporations that don\u2019t satisfy vague ESG standards, the asset managers use their proxy power to change the corporations in leftward directions.\n\nThis raises troubling questions: Aren\u2019t the true owners of these companies the clients of the asset managers, the people whose money the asset managers are investing and supervising? When an asset manager aggregates hundreds of funds, which include companies in which it enjoys voting rights and companies that directly compete, how can the asset manager vote in the best interests of any one of these companies? Aren\u2019t there conflicts of interest?\n\nThe unethical character of companies like BlackRock is finally coming to light.\n\nResponding to warnings from Republican state attorneys general, BlackRock, earlier this month, denied that it \"dictated\" specific emissions targets to companies. Now New York Comptroller Brad Lander, the custodian and delegated investment adviser to the New York City Retirement Systems and a man of the left, decries the apparent contradiction: \"BlackRock cannot simultaneously declare that climate risk is a systemic financial risk and argue that BlackRock has no role in mitigating the risks that climate change poses to its investments by supporting decarbonization in the real economy.\"\n\nThere\u2019s hope. People are pushing back.\n\nThe Manuel H. Johnson Center for Political Economy at Troy University, which I direct, has launched a Free Enterprise Scholars program to teach undergraduates the sound business ethics that are sadly and profoundly lacking among large investment companies. Our numbers are small, but we hope to inspire faculty at other colleges and universities to be courageous, and to provide a forum for those who are aware of the dangers presented by ESG.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation has launched a digital campaign called \"ESG Hurts\" that\u2019s an indispensable resource for anyone hoping to learn more about ESG.
