            "title": "Bill Maher skewers young environmentalists blaming elders for climate change: 'Using cars as much as we did!'",
            "description": "On his podcast, Bill Maher dismissed young environmentalists, telling them that despite their complaints about older generations they drive cars \"as much as we did.\"",
            "content": "On his \"Club Random\"podcast, HBO host Bill Maher went after the progressive, environmental left, calling their criticism of older generations hypocritical and saying he wasn’t going to be the \"schmuck driving the three-dollar car\" in order to fight climate change.\n\nTalking to fellow comedian Dana Carvey, Maher knocked the idea of wealthy environmentalists forgoing the use of private jets: \"I say this now: The only people who don’t fly private are the ones who can’t. Anyone who can, would.\"\n\nMaher said he didn't want to be the only one making sacrifices to save the planet, something needs to be done \"as a group of humans\" for the problem to be solved, but it's been all talk and no action.\n\n\"I just don’t feel like me [not flying private] is making a difference,\" he added. \"We either do this as a group - I’m just not going to be the one schmuck not enjoying my life.\"\n\nBILL MAHER SAYS BIDEN'S FAR LEFT PANDERING MAKES IT HARD TO 'CONVINCE' CENTRIST DEMOCRATS TO VOTE FOR HIM\n\nHighlighting Gen Z environmentalist Greta Thunberg, the host declared her to be an exception as she won’t fly in private jets: \"She’s not representative of her generation who love to blame us.\"\n\nMaher summarized young environmentalists' criticism of their elders as \"you wrecked the world!\" Then retorted, \"Yeah, like you're doing it differently. You're not driving? Right. You're just with Greta on a sailboat all the time. You're using cars as much as we did. So, shut the f--- up!\"\n\nHe jokingly said, \"We're all decided that we’re just going to drive over the Grand Canyon and have a great time on our way. And as long as that's what we decided, I’m not going to be the schmuck driving the three-dollar car.\"\n\nComedian Carvey joined in, dismissing Thunberg with his \"three-word\" impersonation: \"How dare you? How dare you?\"\n\nCarvey offered a middle ground take on the whole discussion, saying of humanity's solutions: \"We're going to try to get to the renewables when they're practical and they can take over for fossil fuels.\"\n\nBut for now, Carvey offered, \"Everyone's a Republican when the lights go out, right?\"\n\nMaher concluded the discussion by pointing out developing nations like India find American environmentalists to be unreasonable in their demands. He imagined them saying, \"Wait, you used [the resources] and now we can’t have air conditioning?\"\n\nOn last week’s podcast, Maher again took on his fellow liberals, saying some of them are \"crazy\" for saying that men can get pregnant. He dismissed the whole idea as a \"Ripley’s Believe It or Not\" joke.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",

            "title": "California's Newsom blames climate change, to seek federal assistance as more storms line up to batter state",
            "description": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom held a press conference on Sunday, where he said he was requesting federal assistance through an emergency declaration.",
            "content": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced during a press conference on Sunday that he is requesting a state of emergency from the White House as another round of storms targets the Golden State this week.\n\nSevere storms in California knocked out power to over 560,000 homes on Sunday.\n\nAlong with power outages, the state has faced several days of severe weather events and two more are scheduled to occur this week. The first storm is expected to begin Monday and go into the early morning hours on Tuesday, and the second storm will occur from Jan. 12-14.\n\nCALIFORNIA STORM KNOCKS OUT POWER FOR 560,000 AS NWS WARNS OF IMPENDING FLOODS\n\n\"We’ve been at this how many days and expect to see the worst of it still in front of us,\" Newsom said. \"We’re anticipating some very intense weather coming in tomorrow, tomorrow evening in particular, into the early hours of Tuesday morning.\"\n\nThe governor and his team referred to these storms as atmospheric rivers, or storms that dump massive amounts of rain, causing flooding, mudslides, property damage and the loss of life.\n\nIn fact, 12 people have died because of flooding during atmospheric river events according to Newsom, making them more deadly than wildfires over the last two years.\n\nCALIFORNIA ARSONISTS SET THEMSELVES ON FIRE WHILE ATTACKING BUSINESS, VIDEO SHOWS\n\n\"These floods are deadly and have now turned to be more deadly than even the wildfires here in the state of California,\" he said. \"Common sense. Just be cautious over the course of the next week, again, particularly the next day or two.\"\n\nFox Weather reported that the National Weather Service advised people in California to stay current with weather forecasts over the next several days as there is a \"direct threat to life and property\" from these upcoming storms.\n\nThe warming comes after a deadly bomb cyclone produced flooding rain, debris flows, damaging winds and large waves in the region last week.\n\nCALIFORNIA STORM LEAVES AT LEAST 1 DEAD, BRINGS DANGEROUS FLOODING AND POWERFUL WINDS\n\nTwo people died in the San Francisco Bay area during the bomb cyclone, one of whom was a child inside a home when a tree fell on it.\n\nIn Fairfield, a 19-year-old woman was killed when her car hydroplaned on a partially flooded road and crashed into a utility pole.\n\nThe latest atmospheric river will push into California late Sunday night and early Monday morning, Fox Weather said, bringing heavy rain and damaging wind to the region.\n\nFlood watches have been issued across the state and are expected to remain in effect through Wednesday.\n\nState officials warned residents that just a foot of water can cause a car to start flooding. When drivers decide to risk driving into flooded areas, Newsom said, they not only put their lives at risk, but also the lives of first responders.\n\nNewsom said he has been in contact with the White House to discuss federal assistance with these storms, and that he was ready to make a formal request on Sunday. He added that he was confident he would get the full support of the federal government.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHe also said the intensity of these atmospheric rivers are not only increasing but are also the result of climate change.\n\n\"Hot’s getting a lot hotter,\" Newsom said. \"Dry’s getting a lot dryer. But the wet’s getting a lot wetter, as well.\"",

            "description": "Democrats used the first Senate Budget Committee hearing of the year to talk about climate, drawing rebukes from Republicans who say the committee should focus on a budget plan.",
            "content": "Democrats this week used the first Senate Budget Committee hearing of the new Congress to talk about climate change, a decision that drew complaints from Republicans who said the committee should focus on producing a budget after it failed to get that job done last year.\n\nThe new chairman of the committee, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., has issued dire warnings about a climate catastrophe for several years and has delivered dozens of climate speeches on the Senate floor alongside a poster of planet Earth that says, \"Time to Wake Up.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Whitehouse convened a Budget Committee hearing on the \"Climate-Related Economic Risks and Their Costs to the Federal Budget.\" Whitehouse argued that big chunks of the $31.4 trillion national debt were added on because of crisis events like the mortgage crisis and COVID and that the impending climate crisis is another crucial challenge that will likely lead to more debt.\n\n\"The reason we’re having this hearing and the reason that we’re going to continue to have hearings on this subject is that $10 trillion of our federal debt can be ascribed to exogenous shocks to our economy with which we had to cope,\" Whitehouse said. \"It wasn’t cheap, but we had to do it. The biggest exogenous shock on the horizon out there is climate upheaval.\"\n\nBut Republicans accused Whitehouse of pursuing a climate agenda in a committee that’s charged with putting together a budget plan, a task that Senate Democrats failed to achieve last year. The top Republican on the committee, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said Democrats were ignoring the purpose of the committee to make it about one of their favorite pet projects.\n\n\"Instead of focusing on the growing national debt, out-of-control deficits or the consequences of our spending addiction, Democrats selected climate change for the topic of their first hearing,\" Grassley said Wednesday. While Grassley said the changing environment is a legitimate issue to consider when looking at the federal budget, he added that the Senate has other committees, like Environment and Public Works and Energy and Natural Resources, to deal with climate issues.\n\n\"Only the budget committee is tasked with developing a budget,\" he said. \"That ought to be our focus.\"\n\nOther Republicans agreed and accused Democrats of trying to inject \"climate hysteria\" into every issue.\n\n\"The United States is more than $31 trillion in debt,\" said committee member Roger Marshall, R-Kan. \"This is the true threat to national security that the Budget Committee should prioritize, not the left’s climate hysteria.\"\n\n\"Let’s not fool ourselves, and most importantly, let’s not fool those we represent, the American people,\" added Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, during the hearing. \"Our ballooning deficits and burgeoning debt have been driven by and will continue to be driven by runaway profligate spending by the federal government, not because of any effects of climate change. That is a different thing.\"\n\nHe said Democrats are using \"climate alarmism\" in order to justify the federal takeover of the U.S. economy.\n\n\"It’s my hope that this committee will spend more of its time and effort this Congress deliberating ways to reduce our budget deficits so that we can stabilize our debt while putting our budget on a pathway to balance,\" he said.\n\nGRASSLEY RIPS SENATE'S SLEEPY WORK SCHEDULE UNDER DEM LEADERSHIP: ‘THINGS NEED TO CHANGE’\n\nRepublicans broadly took the hearing as a sign that Democrats are not serious about reining in federal spending, despite broad consensus among many economists that rampant spending during the COVID pandemic juiced consumer demand and led to inflation levels that hadn’t been seen in decades.\n\nGrassley noted that under Democratic leadership in the last Congress, the Budget Committee failed to approve a budget and the Senate didn’t consider any of the 12 annual spending bills that are supposed to be the mechanism by which Congress manages the federal government.\n\nInstead, Congress passed a $1.7 trillion omnibus spending bill at the end of last year that bumped up federal spending even more, he said.\n\nGrassley said both parties are to blame for the massive national debt but said Democrats played a larger role in ramping up spending during COVID.\n\n\"For decades, Congress turned a blind eye as our nation walked toward a fiscal cliff. But Democrats turned that walk into a sprint,\" he said.\n\n\"In March 2021, Democrats took advantage of an emergency situation to pass a $2 trillion partisan spending bill, even as our economy showed strong signs of recovery. Then as inflation soared to a 40-year high, they doubled down, spending trillions more on their liberal wish lists,\" Grassley added.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn the House, the Republican majority is widely expected to pass a budget resolution this year and send it along to the Senate, but it’s not clear if the Senate will try to pass its own. It’s also not clear if the House Budget Committee will wait for President Joe Biden’s budget proposal – which is already late and not expected to arrive until March – or forge ahead on its own.",

Republicans accused Democrats of trying to inject \"climate hysteria\" into every issue, while Democrats accused them of ignoring the purpose of the committee to make it about one of their favorite pet projects. Democrats blamed both parties for their larger role in ramping up their spending and said Democrats are taking advantage of the debt crisis.",

            "content": "A Utah mom is demanding answers from her local school district after her child was encouraged by her teacher to eat grasshoppers as part of a school project on climate change.\n\nAmanda Wright unloaded on the Nebo School District during an appearance on \"Jesse Watters Primetime\" Thursday after her sixth-grade daughter was instructed to write an argumentative essay in favor of humans eating insects for their protein instead of cows – which some experts say are destroying the Ozone layer with methane gas – for a The assignment did not permit students to disagree with the premise Some students were given extra credit as an incentive to eat the insects.\n\nWright said she contacted the Spring Canyon Middle school's principal Alison Hansen, questioning the assignment which she said made her daughter uncomfortable. However, Wright said shewas brushed off in a series of \"very condescending\" and \"absolutely rude\" exchanges.\n\nUTAH SCHOOL GIVES KIDS ‘DISGUSTING’ INSECTS TO EAT IN CLASS FOR CLIMATE ASSIGNMENT ON COWS KILLING THE EARTH\n\n\"I already went to the school and had a meeting with the principal and six other staff and nothing was done. So I am planning on taking this to the district,\" she told host Jesse Watters. \"I am definitely upset. This is an uncomfortable topic that they’re pushing this agenda on our children, and I’m definitely going to be taking this way up the ladder further.\"\n\nWright's daughter Sage, who joined her in the Fox News interview, said she challenged her teacher Kim Cutler on why students were unable to \"state our opinion and write that we shouldn't be eating bugs,\" but was told there is a lack of evidence to support any opposing arguments.\n\nARIZONA SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER SAYS DISTRICT SHOULD REJECT HIRING TEACHERS WITH CHRISTIAN VALUES: 'NOT...SAFE'\n\n\"There's only one right answer to this essay,\" Cutler can be heard saying in cell phone footage captured by Wright. \"And it's that Americans should be eating bugs. Everyone in the world is eating them, it's healthy for the environment, and there's just, there's only one right answer.\"\n\n\"It's kind of weird that I gave you a topic where there is only one right answer,\" she continued. \"We don't want to eat bugs and it's gross. But should we be eating bugs? Yeah, because we're killing the world by raising cows and animals. So we need to, not get rid of cows, but like, try to balance our diet so that not so much of our land is being used to raise cows, cause it's killing the Ozone layer.\"\n\nAmanda Wright told Fox News Digital she believed the kids were being subjected to \"indoctrination\" into a \" .\"\n\nMIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHER CLAIMS IT'S 'WHITE SUPREMACY' TO OPPOSE THIEVERY: 'BURN THIS MOTHERF----- TO THE GROUND'\n\nCutler later apologized, explaining to Wright that the \"indoctrination\" that humans must eat bugs to protect the environment was .\n\nShe explained that she did not know there were downsides to eating bugs – and apologized for not allowing students to write about an alternative perspective.\n\n\"I am not aware of the agenda part,\" Cutler said. \"I am sorry for that… it wasn't intending to harm anyone.\"\n\nThe school district defended the assignment In a statement to Fox News, arguing that the bugs were purchased from a commercial site that is \"safe for consumption\" and that the teacher offered another topic once parental concerns were voiced.\n\n\"On the questions about extra credit: Yes, the teacher said sure you can have bonus points, almost as an afterthought. There are multiple opportunities for extra credit or bonus points in this class,\" the district said. \"Remember this particular assignment is about finding facts versus opinions to support writing an argumentative essay,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nWhile the district encouraged parents and students to raise concerns with their office, Wright said it is they who are responsible for approving the curriculum and pushing their \"agenda\" onto students.\n\n\"I honestly don’t know what the protocol is for this. I’m not sure what – if the teacher is going to get any heat in this. I’m more concerned about the district and where this curriculum came from and also the principal of the school being very condescending in emails that were sent by concerned parents,\" she told Watters. \"Her response was just absolutely rude and trying to make it look like my daughter had these videos out of context which I don’t appreciate.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSage said she felt uncomfortable returning to school after she and her mom voiced concerns with the assignment.\n\n\"It was kind of awkward going back to school after we talked about this topic,\" she said.\n\n\n\nFox News' Hannah Grossman contributed to this report.",

            "content": "A group of Swiss retirees took their government to a top European court Wednesday over what they claim is its failure to take stronger action on climate change.\n\nLawyers and members of the group Senior Women for Climate Protection appeared before the European Court of Human Rights for a rare public hearing that activists say could mark a legal milestone in legal efforts to force governments to curb greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe group, which counts around 2,000 members across Switzerland with an average age of 73, argues that older women's rights are especially infringed on because they are most affected by the extreme heat that will become more frequent due to global warming, which current Swiss climate policy contributes to.\n\nPOLICE IN SWITZERLAND EVACUATE PARLIAMENT AFTER A MAN BEARING EXPLOSIVES ARRESTED NEAR THE ENTRANCE\n\n\"It’s been proved that we older women are particularly sensitive (to climate change),\" said plaintiff Rosmarie Wydler-Waelti, 73, from Basel. \"We get sick a little bit faster due to heat waves than older men or other groups.\"\n\nAfter exhausting domestic legal avenues, the group has taken its case to the Strasbourg, France-based tribunal in the hope of setting a precedent that will apply to all signatories of the European Convention on Human Rights. It is linked to two further cases brought by other groups that will be heard by the court in the coming months.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"We are suing for our human right to life,\" said Lore Zablonier, a 78-year-old from Zurich who stood outside the court with supporters and the environmental group Greenpeace. \"With this case, we want to help spur politicians into action a little bit.\"",

            "content": "Babies in the womb can be negatively affected by climate change, argued one opinion writer in The New York Times Wednesday.\n\nThe opinion piece written by Jessica Grose was headlined, \"The Effects of Climate Change Can Begin in the Womb.\" Grose based her claim on a study published in The Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, which followed kids who lived through Hurricane Sandy while in their mother's womb, and kids who were born before or were conceived after the storm. According to the Times, the study found elevated psychological issues in kids who lived through Hurricane Sandy while in utero.\n\n\"The study’s authors found that boys who were exposed to Sandy in the womb had elevated risks for \"attention-deficit/disruptive behavioral disorders,\" while girls had elevated risks for anxiety disorders, depressive disorders and phobias,\" Grose wrote.\n\nIN WAKE OF DOBBS V. JACKSON, NEW YORK TIMES COLUMN PRESENTS ABORTION AS ‘FAMILY VALUE,’ ‘MORAL GOOD’\n\nThe columnist searched for solutions to the problem since climate change wasn’t \"going away anytime soon — even if humanity suddenly got our collective act together and started doing more to ameliorate it— and pregnancies will continue to coincide with hurricanes, tornadoes and floods.\"\n\nShe reached out to one of the study's authors who said parents weren't to blame, and called for policymakers to \"invest in communities for children and pregnant women\" to study the long-term affects of disasters on children.\n\nBut the Times columnist called other measures simply a \"Band-Aid\" to solve the problem of climate change. She ultimately pushed for climate legislation as the solution.\n\n\"The burden cannot be on any individual to fix a problem…While, yes, we can ask for increased screening of children who are exposed to natural disasters in utero, that feels like putting a Band-Aid on a deep wound. It’s an inadequate fix to a problem that will cascade over our lives, and our children’s lives, for years to come,\" Grose stated.\n\nCLIMATE FOR KIDS: CARTOON USES ANIMALS TO ADDRESS INS AND OUTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE\n\nAfter citing the Inflation Reduction Act, Grose suggested more aggressive legislation was needed.\n\n\"[B]ut for every delay there’s another disaster, another storm flooding people out of their basement dwellings, another generation of parents left to care for children, potentially not knowing the causes of psychological issues, without the resources to deal with those issues and not enough being done to counter the trend of climate disasters,\" she concluded.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAfter Hurricane Ian hit Florida and South Carolina last month, some in the media used the opportunity to bring up their concerns about climate change and link it to seemingly unrelated issues.\n\nA guest essay in the paper claimed Florida was targeted by the storm because of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis hadn't taken enough measures to combat climate change.\n\nAnother article in the Washington Post claimed hotter temperatures due to climate change, fueled a rise in hate speech.",

            "description": "The new chair of the House China Select Committee is accusing the Biden administration of being \"divided\" on whether climate change or China is most dangerous to U.S. national security.",
            "content": "EXCLUSIVE: House China Select Committee Chairman Mike Gallagher called the Biden administration \"divided\" on whether Beijing or climate change poses the greatest national security threat to the United States, telling Fox News Digital that the split is the reason for the administration’s \"policy incoherence.\"\n\nRep. Gallagher, R-Wis., is leading the new House committee focused on combating the threat China poses to the United States – a panel created for the 118th Congress by House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, and established with broad bipartisan support.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News Digital, Gallagher said he has a relationship with the Biden administration and is confident that the committee will be able to work with officials, despite disagreements in approach.\n\nWHITE HOUSE SAYS US, CHINA DIPLOMATIC CHANNELS MAY ‘EXPAND’ FOLLOWING BIDEN, XI MEETING\n\n\"We can still have a bipartisan spirit that makes room for thoughtful disagreement,\" Gallagher said.\n\nAnd the White House National Security Council told Fox News Digital it plans to work with the committee on the matter.\n\n\"Under President Biden, we are more prepared to outcompete China, protect our national security, and advance a free and open Indo-Pacific than ever before,\" NSC spokesperson Adrienne Watson told Fox News Digital. \"Many of the efforts we have been pursuing are bipartisan, underscoring the alignment at home on this key issue.\" \n\n\n\nShe added: \"We look forward to the committee getting stood up and we will continue working with Democrats and Republicans in Congress on this top priority.\"\n\nBut Gallagher said a challenge could be the apparent split between Biden administration officials in what the greatest threat to the nation is, and prioritizing how to address that threat.\n\n\"I think the White House is divided,\" Gallagher said. \"The chairman of the joint chiefs will say China is our biggest short-term, near-term, long-term threat.\"\n\nOfficials like FBI Director Christopher Wray, CIA Director William Burns and Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines have repeatedly warned that China poses the greatest threat to the national security of the United States.\n\nOPINION: CHINA'S XI WANTS TO USE CAPITALISM TO SAVE COMMUNISM. BIDEN, WEST MUST NOT TAKE THE BAIT\n\n\"But you have some of this tension because there is a substantial portion of the administration that actually believes that climate change is our biggest existential threat,\" Gallagher said, referring to officials like White House climate czar John Kerry.\n\n\"If you read the national security strategy, it talks about climate – I think it says it is an 'existential challenge' of our time, and so, this creates incoherence and lack of consistent prioritization,\" Gallagher said. \"And it leads someone like John Kerry to advocate against the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, because he knows that solar panels subcomponents are built with slave labor in China.\"\n\n\"So I think that sort of competition between the two camps in the Biden administration explains a lot of their policy incoherence,\" he added.\n\nBut a senior administration official told Fox News that they are focusing on climate change as \"a way to compete with China.\"\n\nThe official pointed to the bipartisan infrastructure bill, which they say positions the U.S. to \"outspend China\" for the first time. The official also pointed to the Inflation Reduction Act, saying the administration is focusing on making \"huge investments\" to create U.S.-based manufacturing jobs and strengthening supply chains.\n\n\"Regarding China and climate change: We are focused on putting the full weight of the Biden administration’s national security and foreign policy enterprise behind the kinds of investments in our national strength that are the basis for strong inclusive economic growth, competitiveness, and American leadership in the key industries of the future that will sustain and grow the American middle class,\" the official said.\n\n\"We've been very clear about China and the threat it poses,\" the official continued, pointing to the administration's national security and defense strategy. \"China is seen as the greatest geopolitical threat.\"\n\nThat threat, Gallagher says, is one he views in \"three dimensions\" – a military threat, an economic threat and an ideological threat.\n\nWith regard to the military threat, Gallagher warned that a possible Chinese invasion of Taiwan could \"potentially bring us into kinetic confrontation with China.\"\n\nCHINA COULD INVADE TAIWAN BEFORE THE 2024 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION: SOURCES\n\n\"I believe time is not on our side and that we have entered the window of maximum danger,\" Gallagher told Fox News Digital.\n\nFox News reported this summer that China could invade Taiwan within the next 18 months, according to current and former officials familiar with U.S. and allied intelligence – specifically through amphibious assault and military invasion.\n\nGallagher said his panel would likely play a \"supporting\" role with regard to the military threat, as that topic falls under the jurisdiction of the House Foreign Affairs Committee under Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, and the House Armed Services Committee under Mike Rogers, R-Ala.\n\nWith regard to the economy, Gallagher warned that the economic threat \"manifests itself in the nature of critical dependency on China in various areas.\" He added: \"Think about the absurdity of that – in many cases, we are relying on China for the things that we put in our weapons systems that we might need in a future war with China.\"\n\nGallagher told Fox News Digital that the United States \"needs to ensure that we’re not subsidizing our own destruction.\"\n\nMCCARTHY, GOP, DEMS UNITE BEHIND NEW CHINA COMMITTEE: ‘THE ERA OF TRUSTING COMMUNIST CHINA IS OVER’\n\nAs for the ideological threat, Gallagher said this is a \"competition between two very different systems of government.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Gallagher touted the Republican members appointed to the panel – all of whom, he said, are \"serious, sober members that represent a wide swath of the caucus and represent almost every committee that affects this issue.\"\n\nPENTAGON OFFICIAL SAYS 'ONLY A MATTER OF TIME' BEFORE CHINA CAUSES 'MAJOR' INCIDENT IN INDO-PACIFIC REGION\n\nDemocrats have yet to appoint members to the panel, but Gallagher urged them to \"take this seriously.\"\n\n\"We do not want this to be a Republican-only effort,\" he said. \"We want Democrats to participate and we want them to appoint serious, sober members as well.\"",

            "content": "Republican lawmakers are tearing into U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm after she held up China as a model for the United States to emulate on climate change.\n\nAt the annual SXSW conference in Austin, Texas, on Friday, Granholm praised China's efforts to tackle climate change, saying the communist country \"has been very sensitive, and has actually invested a lot in their solutions, to achieve their goals.\"\n\n\"We're hopeful that, you know, we can all learn from what China is doing,\" Granholm said.\n\nHer comments drew a heated response from GOP House members, who accused her of \"siding with China against American energy producers.\"\n\nENERGY SECRETARY GRANHOLM CLAIMS US CAN ‘LEARN FROM WHAT CHINA IS DOING’ ON CLIMATE CHANGE\n\nRep. Larry Buschon, a Republican from Indiana, called Granholm \"delusional\" and said she should resign.\n\n\"After her comments on climate change praising China and criticizing the U.S. in the same breath, Energy Sec. Granholm should resign. She is delusional,\" Buschon tweeted. \"China has no plans to address their emissions. Since 2005 we have reduced emissions more than any other country in the world.\"\n\nRep. Ashley Hinson, R-Iowa, added that China \"is the world's top polluter\" and said the Biden administration should \"stop taking China's lies at face value & hold them accountable.\"\n\nThe U.S. and China have on the climate crisis in the last couple of years, though some experts don’t believe that China is as serious about protecting the climate as the country claims.\n\nBIDEN ADMIN CRACKS DOWN ON WASHERS, FRIDGES IN LATEST CLIMATE ACTION: 'OVERREGULATION ON STEROIDS'\n\nGranholm's comments came despite the fact that China recently hit its coal-production record last year. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, \"55% of China’s energy\" now comes from coal \"compared to 11% in the U.S.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTexas Public Policy Foundation chief national initiatives officer Chuck DeVore told Fox News Digital in February that China’s climate change initiatives are \" to engage gullible Westerners into thinking that somehow we can get meaningful cooperation.\"",

The comments drew a heated response from GOP House members, who accused her of \"siding with China against American energy producers\" and said she should resign. The U.K. Energy Information Administration estimates that 55% of China’s energy now comes from coal, which is 11% of the energy produced by the U.N. according to the US.",

            "title": "Biden says climate change could cause Colorado River to dry up during ritzy DNC dinner: 'Not a joke'",
            "description": "President Joe Biden told dozens of Democratic donors that climate change was one of the worst problems facing the United States and urged swift action to address it.",
            "content": "President Biden participated in a second reception this week for the Democratic National Committee in Las Vegas, Nevada, where he urged those in attendance to take climate change more seriously.\n\nJust one day after a fundraiser in Rancho Santa Fe, California, where Biden accidentally revealed a previously unknown detail about former President Jimmy Carter’s health, he made a number of off-the-cuff comments about climate change including one about the Colorado River drying up.\n\n\"You’re not going to be able to drink out of the Colorado River,\" Biden said to a crowd of about 60 people. He also likened climate change to nuclear war as a \"truly existential threat\" facing the country.\n\nHe continued: \"This is serious stuff. It's the single most dire consequence. If we don't keep it below 1.5 degrees Celsius, not go above that, we're going to damn our children to circumstances where we are the only, truly existential threat of nuclear war.\"\n\nIn addition to climate change, Biden also referenced a potential succession by Eastern Oregon counties — which Biden mistakenly called \"Western Oregon\" — to Idaho and ongoing budget negotiations with congressional Republicans.\n\n\"I met with the speaker of the house, he’s not a bad guy, he’s a decent guy,\" Biden said of Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., amid stalled budget negotiations.\n\n\"And he sat with me and said what are we going to do? Said I'll tell you what, I'll my submit my budget in detail on the ninth of March. You submit yours and we'll negotiate,\" the president added.\n\nRICK SCOTT REBUKES BIDEN IN BUDGET LETTER TO WHITE HOUSE, SAYS HE HAS MADE 'THE SITUATION WORSE’\n\nRepublicans are \"telling me that unless I vote the way they want, I go along with their budget, they're not going to, in fact, pay our debts,\" he continued. \"We're going to, for the first time in American history, renege on the federal debt.\"\n\n\"We've never failed to pay it and the interest is accumulated on it and we continue to pay it,\" Biden said. \"If we've ever going to renege on it, we're going to see a national economic crisis not only here but worldwide.\"\n\nThe president also championed his Inflation Reduction Act and the impact it will have on Medicare costs and drug prices. Biden is also expected to address drug prices Wednesday.\n\nHe also made a reference to former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, whom Vegas’ main airport was renamed after, and his fight to lower drug costs.\n\n\"Back in Harry Reid days he was fighting for it too,\" Biden said. \"We pay the highest drug prices of any advanced nation in the world, the highest in the world.\"\n\nBIDEN VOWS TO BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS 'COME HELL OR HIGH WATER'\n\nBiden was initially greeted when he landed at Harry Reid International Airport by Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman, Rep. Dina Titus, D-NV, and Clark County Commission Chairman Jim Gibson.\n\nThe President praised his and the Democrat Party's record over the last two years and speculated more could be done with congressional Republicans, including the long-delayed vote to confirm former Mayor of Los Angeles Eric Garcetti to be ambassador to India.\n\n\"Tomorrow’s an important vote on one of our ambassadors,\" Biden said.\n\nBIDEN TO SIGN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO REQUIRE BACKGROUND CHECKS ON MORE GUN SALES\n\nThe fundraiser came hours after the president left Monterey Park, California, where he signed an executive order and gave a speech about reducing gun violence.\n\nIn January, a lone shooter fatally shot 11 people before taking his own life near a ballroom dance studio in Monterey Park. Nine others were wounded during the incident.\n\n\"A day of festivity and light turned into a day of fear and darkness,\" Biden said earlier Tuesday. \"A holiday of hope and possibilities marked by horror and pain. Vibrant dances and music replaced by vigils and memorials. Eleven souls taken.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Survivors will always carry the physical and emotional scars. Families left behind will never be the same,\" the president said.\n\n\n\nHe called the incident \"one of the worst mass shootings in California history\" and said it was \"a tragedy that has pierced the soul of this nation, here in Monterey Park, in the San Gabriel Valley, the heart of the Asian American community.\"",

The president praised his and the Democrat Party's record over the last two years and speculated more could be done with Congress Republicans. The fundraiser came hours after the president left Monterey Park, California, and gave a speech about reducing gun violence.",

            "description": "New York Times columnist wonders why the US did not spend more money on climate change during the pandemic",
            "content": "The New York Times published a newsletter Wednesday which argued that the United States did not spend enough money to combat climate change during the pandemic.\n\nTitled \"What if we had spent more money on climate?\", the piece was written by David Wallace-Wells, who \"explores climate change, technology, and the future of the planet and how we live on it\" in his columns.\n\nWallace-Wells argued that \"the opportunity flashed brightly for climate action\" because of the \"crazily expansive period of public expenditure\" during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"For a moment, with free spending and loose money in wealthy capitals suggesting that Modern Monetary Theory had initiated a whole new steroid era of Keynesianism, something like a Green New Deal seemed not just conceivable but potentially the basic model for public investment the world over,\" he wrote.\n\nFOX NEWS POLL: AMERICANS WEIGH IN ON BIDEN'S JOB PERFORMANCE AS GAS PRICES, INTEREST RATES SOAR\n\nWallace-Wells recalled an increased focus by some on climate change pre-pandemic. \"There was just so much money that was going to be spent, and given that the world had seemed to reach a fever pitch of climate alarm just before the first lockdowns, it was easy for those who’d spent years or decades trying to squeeze water from a stone on climate policy to imagine that the outlines of a new playbook might be finally emerging,\" he wrote.\n\nHe criticized the Biden administration for not including climate change policies in COVID relief funds, instead bundling it in the Build Back Better bill.\n\n\"With both choices, the signal was there: The pandemic represented a different kind of emergency, requiring a different scale of ambition and urgency, and climate, while important, could be tabled now for debate in a more conventional political setting,\" he argued.\n\nBIDEN, DEMOCRATS BELIEVE AMERICANS' ECONOMIC STRUGGLES ‘NECESSARY PRICE TO PAY TO SAVE PLANET': SEXTON\n\nHe lamented that the Biden administration did not handle climate change funds and regulations with the same grandiosity.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDespite what he views as a missed opportunity to combat climate change during the pandemic, Wallace-Wells expressed hope that policymakers can utilize the Russia-Ukraine war as an \"opportunity\" to expedite the world’s energy transition.\n\n\"But if you’re inclined to regard the pandemic as a uniquely tragic missed opportunity for climate, the invasion of Ukraine presents, possibly, a sequel: a climate test that is also a climate opportunity,\" he wrote.",

            "content": "Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates said during an interview that was published on Wednesday that the \"scariest\" thing about the war in Ukraine was it being a distraction from climate change.\n\nNew York Times opinion writer David Wallace-Wells interviewed the billionaire, where he asked about a progress report from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation that tracks progress on several issues like poverty and food security. The report shows progress is lagging in most data points.\n\nWhen asked about the progress report, Gates said he is concerned that the war in Ukraine and economic troubles are distracting the world from confronting what he perceives as the threat from climate change.\n\n\"We’re in a worse place than I expected,\" Gates said.\n\nPENTAGON ACCUSED OF ‘IDEOLOGICAL LITMUS TEST’ OVER VACCINE MANDATE: ‘PROBABLY BREAKING THE LAW’\n\nWhile other commentators have expressed concern that the war in Ukraine can inadvertently lead to nuclear weapons conflict, Gates is concerned it will distract the world from climate change.\n\n\"But the scariest thing of all is not that we’re behind. We just have to accept that. It’s the ongoing distraction of the war in Ukraine from helping poor countries and making progress on both climate adaptation and mitigation,\" he continued.\n\nWallace noted how the report shows that the world is on track to achieve almost none of the goals that were first outlined in 2015 by the United Nations.\n\nNPR REPORT DEFENDS ESG, SAYS REPUBLICANS ARE ‘TRYING TO SCORE POLITICAL POINTS’\n\nGates also pointed to economic troubles - the possibility of a global recession, rising interest rates sparked by rising inflation, and high debt levels as things that will reduce the importance of climate change in the eyes of the public.\n\n\"That’s a huge thing — whether it’s defense costs, electricity costs, refugee costs, fertilizer costs. With the war on top of the pandemic, and now with interest rates going up, with high levels of debt everywhere, but including in Africa, the next five years are going to be challenging just to maintain the world’s attention,\" he said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn addition, Gates predicted because of the rising costs of fertilizer, Africa will experience lower productivity when it comes to agriculture due to being priced out of the market.\n\n\"The cost of fertilizer, though, is a gigantic setback, because when the world makes less fertilizer, who uses less fertilizer? Africa’s not buying nearly as much fertilizer as they did a few years ago,\" he said. \"And so they’re the ones who are being priced out of the market. And what that does is, it means a season from now or two seasons from now, three seasons from now, your productivity is actually down from where we are right now. In the near term, it’s a pretty bleak picture for African agriculture.\"",

            "content": "\"The View\" co-host Joy Behar slammed Gov. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., on Wednesday for previous comments about climate change while discussing Hurricane Ian and his leadership.\n\n\"Hurricanes intensified by climate change, rising sea level, extreme heat and drought and this one is the worse one, health threats from mosquito-born diseases. This is the quote from Governor DeSantis about climate change, quote, ‘I am not in the pews of the church of the global warming leftists.’\"\n\n\"This is what he thinks about climate change,\" she said, adding that \"his state\" was about to get hit with one of the worst hurricanes they'll ever see.\n\nHurricane Ian is nearing Category 5 hurricane status as it approaches Florida's coast.\n\n'THE VIEW' HOSTS REJOICE OVER NEW YORK LAWSUIT AGAINST TRUMP BUT WORRY IT COULD AMOUNT TO ‘NOTHING’\n\n\"He's the President of the United States, that includes Florida. And you don't have to, you don't have to agree with them about stuff but these are his people, your people our people, that's what you're supposed to do,\" co-host Whoopi Goldberg said after playing multiple clips of DeSantis noting the help he's been given from the Biden administration.\n\nBehar responded by saying, \"Isn't this socialism, when the government helps you?\"\n\nShe also said DeSantis could have used some of the money spent to send migrants to Martha's Vineyard to help with Hurricane Ian.\n\nBehar and fellow \"View\" co-host Sunny Hostin said it was $12 million dollars, and were both met with applause.\n\nHostin wondered what sort of leadership they would see from DeSantis, \"when you think about a DeSantis, in my view, he's like, you know, he likes to have like a little fiefdom.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBehar slammed Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., on Tuesday for speaking at an event with Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., about bipartisanship.\n\nAfter saying Sinema was very unpopular among different groups in Arizona, she said she also wouldn't be popular with Republicans.\n\n\"She’s not going to be popular with the Republicans either. Because, she doesn’t have a religion, so that's, as far as I could tell, and she says that she’s bisexual, they don’t like that, so I think she has a problem, she does not help the Democrats. We don't need her. We need a strong Democrat in Arizona like Mark Kelly,\" Behar said.",

            "description": "The Defense Department wants to know what service members know about climate change, how climate is affecting their jobs and where they get information about climate change.",
            "content": "The Department of Defense (DOD) is asking thousands of active-duty service members and civilian DOD workers if they have enough information on climate change to do their jobs effectively and requesting to know where they get their climate news.\n\nThe Pentagon asked these and other questions as part of its \"2022 Climate Literacy Pulse Check,\" according to a copy of the questionnaire reviewed by Fox News Digital.\n\nThe questions went out to thousands of recipients, and DOD described it as a short, voluntary poll that would be used to make sure the department is able to protect U.S. national security in light of changing climate conditions.\n\n\"As we train and educate our service members to fight and prevail against our adversaries, so too must we ensure our service members have the knowledge to ensure mission success in the face of a changing climate,\" Cmdr. Nicole Schwegman, a Pentagon spokesperson, told Fox News Digital in statement. The Pentagon declined to say how many service members received the questionnaire.\n\n\"To ensure the United States armed forces retain their warfighting edge and remain the world’s most lethal and capable fighting force, the Department of Defense worked with the Office of Management and Budget to craft a short, fully anonymous, at-will questionnaire – not a survey – to assess the degree to which the DOD workforce feels it is capable of executing its mission in the context of a changing climate,\" she added.\n\nBut Rep. Mike Rogers of Alabama, the top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, disagreed and said DOD's poll is a distraction from the core mission of the U.S. Armed Forces.\n\n\"The Department of Defense should not be wasting our service members’ time with surveys on climate change,\" he said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"The military should not be distracted from its mission of maintaining the most lethal and capable force in the world.\"\n\nQuestions asked by the poll are mostly aimed at understanding how climate change is affecting respondents’ work and how respondents learn about climate change.\n\nThe questionnaire asked whether respondents think climate change will affect their work or their organization’s mission and whether they are \"integrating climate change considerations into your regular responsibilities.\"\n\nIt then asked several detailed questions about the source of their climate change information. It asked if they have the \"right amount of knowledge/information on climate change\" needed to perform their jobs, and it then asked where they go to learn more.\n\nDEMOCRATS VS. THE MILITARY: WOKENESS WON'T WIN WARS AND KEEP AMERICA SAFE\n\nOne possible answer to that last question is the internet, and if that answer is selected, it asks the respondent to list specific websites. Other options include research reports from think tanks and other educational materials.\n\nAnother question asks respondents what other information on \"climate security\" would be helpful as they do their work. A range of responses is suggested, including basic climate information, the effect of climate change on missions, military infrastructure and public health, energy efficiency and \"changes in contracting requirements to account for greenhouse gases.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe questionnaire ended by asking about respondents’ level of education and what kind of training they may have received, including seminars, briefings and \"work experience in planning and design for climate change.\"\n\n\"All data will be reported in the aggregate, and will be used to inform DOD education and training efforts,\" it said.",

            "description": "Democrats' witness at a House hearing Tuesday blasted supporters of the Inflation Reduction Act, which passed with Democratic support, for “permitting a climate apocalypse.”",
            "content": "Democrats' witness at a House Natural Resources Committee hearing Tuesday blasted supporters of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) last year for \"permitting a climate apocalypse.\"\n\nJohn Beard, Jr., the founder and president of the Texas-based Port Arthur Community Action Network, particularly criticized the IRA for several provisions that open up millions of acres of federal land and waters to fossil fuel drilling. He said the $739 billion legislation would effectively green-light offshore drilling for decades to come, putting communities like his \"at risk.\"\n\nEvery Democratic member of the committee — excluding four members who entered office this year — voted for the IRA in August.\n\n\"We no longer have the luxury of debating whether or not we should open up our oceans to more oil and gas drilling,\" Beard wrote in an Aug. 1 op-ed for The Hill. \"If the Biden administration and our elected officials choose to dismiss the warning signs, ignore their own commitments and cave to the fossil fuel industry’s demands, they are all complicit in permitting a climate apocalypse.\"\n\nREPUBLICANS' SPR BILL LEAVES DEMOCRATS SQUIRMING OVER OIL LEASING: 'IT'S THE PROCESS OF BALANCE'\n\n\"We can’t keep flying past these warning signs and flashing lights — we must understand that new drilling is a death sentence for the Gulf Coast and for our planet,\" Beard continued. \"If you think I am being alarmist, I invite you to come down to the Gulf Coast and see what the fossil fuel industry has done to our air, water and health — you can come see firsthand why we don’t want any new leases.\"\n\nThe IRA, which was signed by President Biden and authored by Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., requires the federal government to , an offshore lease sale stretching across 80 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico, and to hold three other offshore lease sales that the Biden administration had previously canceled over climate concerns.\n\nThe bill also tethers new renewable energy leases to . Under the bill, the DOI is prohibited from issuing wind or solar permits unless it has issued an onshore oil and gas permit during the previous 120-day period and at least two million acres of land was leased for oil and gas development during the previous year.\n\nBeard, meanwhile, was the sole witness called by the Democratic minority to testify during the Natural Resources Committee hearing on Tuesday. The hearing was called to review pending legislation on boosting energy production and reforming energy infrastructure permitting.\n\nDuring the hearing, Beard said his home community of Port Arthur, Texas, had been exploited by the fossil fuel industry and victimized by \"environmental racism.\"\n\n\"I live in Port Arthur, Jefferson County, Texas, an environmental justice community afflicted by institutionalized environmental racism,\" he stated. \"West Port Arthur is a predominantly Black community along the Gulf Coast of Texas, that has been an economic and energy ‘sacrifice zone’ for the fossil fuel industry.\"\n\nIn January, though, Democratic leaders including Natural Resources Ranking Member Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz., defended their affirmative votes for the IRA, explaining that the new oil and gas drilling was a fair price for the bill's investments in green energy.\n\n\"In terms of the Inflation Reduction [Act], in terms of the piece of legislation where we voted for mandated sales, it's the process of balance,\" Grijalva said in response to a question from Fox News Digital on Jan. 24. \"[The IRA] provided the most resources historically to deal with the real issue of the climate crisis and climate action associated with those resources. That was the balance, that was the investment.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"What we're trying to do as Democrats, with the Inflation Reduction Act as our primary vehicle, is to encourage renewables — wind, offshore wind, solar and other renewable resources through tax credits and other means that we put in the Inflation Reduction Act. That's one of the reasons that we support it,\" Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., added.\n\nPallone, the top Democratic member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, added that they are trying to be responsible and \"move away from fossil fuels at the same time that you're still pumping more fossil fuels.\"",

Beard said the $739 billion legislation would effectively green-light offshore drilling for decades to come, putting communities like his \"at risk\". The hearing was called to review pending legislation on boosting energy production and reforming energy infrastructure permitting. In January, Democratic leaders defended their affirmative votes for the IRA, explaining that the new oil and gas drilling was a fair price for the bill's investments in green energy. Beard also said his home community of Port Arthur, Texas, had been exploited by the fossil fuel industry and victimized by \"environmental racism\".",

            "description": "CNN chief climate correspondent Bill Weir frequently criticizes Republicans for inaction on climate change and predicts the end of a habitable Earth.",
            "content": "CNN chief climate correspondent Bill Weir has repeatedly engaged in alarmist rhetoric in his coverage and in his personal tweets since joining the network back in 2013, even wondering if Republicans could spell the end of life on Earth.\n\nOn Friday, Weir posted and then quickly deleted a tweet that accused Republicans in Congress of possibly ushering in the end of the world by failing to vote for the Inflation Reduction Act, the massive health care, energy and climate bill President Biden signs into law on Tuesday.\n\n\"Not a single Republican in either chamber voted for the first piece of ambitious climate legislation in U.S. history,\" Weir began. \"Best case, they let their opponents become the party of Industrial Revolution 2.0. Worst case, their obstruction hastens the end of a livable Earth.\"\n\nJust several hours later Weir deleted the post, and in a subsequent tweet admitted his original post was \"poorly worded\" and apologized.\n\nThis is far from the first instance in which the CNN climate correspondent ruminated on the fate of life on earth and the Republican Party’s complicity.\n\nFilibuster Is A ‘Made-up American Rule,’ U.S. Democracy Cannot Survive Crisis\n\nIn late July, while speaking with CNN anchor Jim Sciutto, Weir claimed the fate of American democracy and the planet was in jeopardy if Congress failed to take action on climate change.\n\n\"This is hung up on an old-fashioned filibuster, sort of recent, made-up American rules, where the fate of life on earth is at stake and doesn’t seem to match,\" Weir said. He added he did not believe the U.S. government had the capabilities to \"stomach\" a \"climate crisis.\"\n\n\"What kind of governments can?\" Weir asked. \"And I think the proof that we see around us is that the American form of democracy, the 2022 version certainly cannot.\"\n\nIn December, Weir conducted a climate-edition year in review where he warned that the world is \"close to a point of no return.\" When discussing Greenland, the climate correspondent asserted that the country’s ice could sink Miami, Boston, Bangkok and Shanghai were it to melt.\n\nCNN GUESTS CLAIM CLIMATE CHANGE IS 'LARGER THAN THE HOLOCAUST'\n\nDrumming up his dire wording, Weir echoed the words of the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change when he announced a \"code red for humanity\" and claimed the planet’s temperature was veering \"dangerously close to a point of no return.\"\n\nAnother portion of the segment saw Weir state a shortage of the Colorado River, wildfires, and droughts were all connected, and warned\"the worst is yet to come.\"\n\nIn one CNN segment during the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, Weir attributed the cause of the pandemic to deforestation.\n\n\"Virologists for years tried to warn us that an invisible enemy would come out of the jungles if we just kept cutting all of them down, and they were right,\" Weir said. \"So if any good can come of this, maybe it's an understanding that the climatologists who are warning of an invisible enemy up in our skies and in our seas, maybe we should take them seriously too.\"\n\nWeir also said there was a perception that the coronavirus had \"helped humanity\" buy some time in the fight against climate change. His words were highlighted by the Washington Examiner on Twitter, to which Weir fired back.\n\nCNN'S BILL WEIR SLAMMED AS 'MISOGYNISTIC,' 'SEXIST' FOR TWEET ABOUT SEN. KELLY LOEFFLER'S MARRIAGE\n\n‘\"That is such a false, s****** bad faith headline. The full question was ‘there seems to be this perception that coronavirus has helped humanity buy some time against global warning. Tell us what’s wrong with that assumption.’ The entire takeaway is THERE IS NO SILVER LINING,\" Weir wrote.\n\nLetter To Newborn Son, Suggests Bible Is To Blame For Climate Change\n\nJust days later, Weir penned an article for CNN in the form of a letter to his newborn son, apologizing for humanity's destruction of the planet, and suggesting the words of the Bible had provoked the planet’s downward spiral.\n\nThe piece, titled \"To my son, born in the time of coronavirus and climate change,\" apologized to his child for how humanity \"broke\" his sea and sky, and admitted he would learn to walk on an Earth that has never been hotter, and drink from a milk bottle warned by fossil fuels.\n\n\"As you get older, this will be hard to understand. But we were under the spell of Genesis 1:28: to take dominion over every living thing. We had the strange urge to carve straight lines out of nature's curves and were under the spell of a uniquely human force called ‘profit motive,’\" Weir said.\n\nWeir and CNN didn't respond to requests for comment about how Weir views his role at the network, given his tendency to editorialize.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nClimate change has come back into the forefront of media coverage in the last several months as the Biden administration has pushed green energy policies. The Senate on Sunday passed the Democrats' Inflation Reduction Act, which included $369 billion in spending for climate initiatives while imposing a 15% minimum tax on large corporations. The act could reduce U.S. carbon emissions by around 40% from 2005 levels by 2030, the research firm Energy Innovation found.\n\nFox News’ Lisa Bennatan, Gabriel Hays and David Rutz contributed to this report.",

            "content": "Representatives and negotiators from nearly 200 countries have reached a historic agreement to pay reparations to poor countries said to be victimized by climate change, though proponents say more is needed to scale back fossil fuels.\n\nThe deal, gaveled around dawn in the Egyptian Red Sea resort city of Sharm El-Sheikh, established a fund for what negotiators call \"loss and damage.\"\n\nIt was a big win for poorer nations that have long called for money — sometimes viewed as \"reparations\" — because they are often the victims of floods, droughts, heat waves, famines and storms despite having contributed little to the pollution that heats up the globe.\n\nWhile the fund would be largely aimed at the most vulnerable nations, there would be room for middle-income countries severely battered by climate disasters to get aid.\n\nDetails of the fun have yet to be worked out. It will likely be a major topic at next year's climate conference in the United Arab Emirates in 2023. So far, only a few nations have made significant pledges for payments.\n\nPOLL SHOWS RELIGIOUS AMERICANS ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE CONCERNED WITH CLIMATE CHANGE\n\nThe fund would initially draw on contributions from developed countries and other private and public sources, such as international financial institutions. While major emerging economies such as China – the second-largest economy in the world and the top emitter – wouldn't automatically have to contribute, that option remains on the table. This was a key demand by the European Union and the United States. They argue that China and other large polluters currently classified as developing countries have the financial clout and responsibility to pay their way.\n\nEnvironment officials in developing nations hailed Sunday’s development as an investment in the future and a \"win for our entire world.\" Others, particularly EU officials, expressed disappointment that attendees failed to make more robust commitments to scaling back fossil fuels and cutting emissions.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhile the new agreement doesn't ratchet up calls for reducing emissions, it does retain language to keep alive the global goal of limiting warming to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit. Next year's talks will also see further negotiations to work out details of the new loss and damage fund, as well as review the world's efforts to meet the goals of the Paris accord.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "content": "Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry lauded fellow attendees at the World Economic Forum's (WEF) annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, for trying to save the planet.\n\nKerry characterized efforts to combat climate change and save the planet as \"almost extraterrestrial\" given their scope in his remarks earlier Tuesday. He also downplayed criticism that has been levied against such climate activism, noting that \"most people\" believe he and the other WEF participants are just \"crazy\" tree huggers.\n\n\"When you start to think about it, it's pretty extraordinary that we — select group of human beings because of whatever touched us at some point in our lives — are able to sit in a room and come together and actually talk about saving the planet,\" Kerry remarked. \"I mean, it's so almost extraterrestrial to think about ‘saving the planet.’\"\n\n\"If you say that to most people, most people think you're just a crazy tree-hugging, lefty, liberal, you know, do-gooder or whatever and there's no relationship,\" he added. \"But really, that's where we are.\"\n\nWORLD ECONOMIC FORUM CHAIR KLAUS SCHWAB DECLARES ON CHINESE STATE TV: 'CHINA IS A MODEL FOR MANY NATIONS'\n\nKerry — who delivered the speech during a WEF session titled \"Philanthropy: A Catalyst for Protecting Our Planet\" — added that \"allegedly wise adult human beings\" still want to ignore the science, mathematics and physics of climate change. He also said half the species on Earth have already been killed, an apparent reference to a 2020 study predicting that global warming would eliminate half of the planet’s animal and plant species by 2070.\n\nHe also said the current growth trajectory of the world is unsustainable and implored world leaders to double down on climate commitments and policies, saying not nearly enough has been done to stave off the worst of climate change.\n\n\"If you look at the way we live, the incredible sort of destructive process of growth the way we interpret it — not as enlightened growth, but as a sort of robber baron growth — growth driven by a lot of different things,\" he said. \"We had 18 separate $1 billion events in the United States last year. And you look at Pakistan with 30 million people, in one single event, displaced and their lives were affected. An extraordinary upheaval.\"\n\n\"We have to find a way to get really serious about bringing the corporate world on board around the world,\" he continued.\n\n\"We're not doing everything we promised,\" Kerry added. \"Nobody.\"\n\nKerry's comments come as the Biden administration and other Western nations push an aggressive green transition from fossil fuels to alternative energy sources. In his role at the State Department, Kerry has engaged in high-level climate policy talks with international counterparts and led U.S. delegations to climate summits and events.\n\nThe WEF conference marked the latest forum in which world leaders have come together to discuss ways to limit global warming.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHowever, such negotiations and policies have been criticized for their potential impact on both wealthy and poor nations.\n\n\"We're telling developing nations that we don't want them to go through the process of developing, we don't want them to have coal or natural gas or even nuclear. We want them to use wind and solar which is intermittent, which is ineffective, which is incredibly cost-prohibitive,\" Daniel Turner, the executive director of Power The Future, previously told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"It's the epitome of privilege,\" he continued. \"There is no greater white privilege than being a climate change activist. It is the privilege of rich and elite folks — you could even throw in the word godless if you wanted — who need to feel like they care about something in this world. So, they cling to the climate change cult, but they're unaffected by the consequences of it.\"",

Can EGC and SPEC take a look and clear?\"\n\n\"Thanks for sharing … I think this sounds like a fantastic FPC (virtual) reporting tour and I'm looking forward to the stories that will come out of this,\" a second redacted official responded one day later.\n\nHOUSE REPUBLICANS PREPARING TO GRILL JOHN KERRY OVER HIS OFFICE'S GREEN GROUP TIES, INTERNAL OPERATIONS\n\nThe FPC reporting tour — titled \"Combating the Climate Crisis Through U.S. Innovation\" — ultimately took place during a two-week stretch in May 2021. The event was designed to \"promote the Administration’s goal of prioritizing the fight against climate change through global efforts to reduce emissions,\" according to the State Department.\n\n\"The FPC … offered this virtual program to enable journalists to remotely develop their reporting about the United States’ renewed approach to addressing the climate crisis and its innovation and research, particularly in the areas of reducing emissions and renewable energy,\" the State Department states on its website.\n\nWhile the State Department quietly announced the program in 2021, though, it failed to mention that it would be funded by U.S. taxpayer money or that the foreign reporters would be \"sponsored.\" It is unclear which reporters and outlets were sponsored by the State Department program.\n\nThe tour came as the Biden administration was moving forward with its aggressive green energy and climate push.\n\nThe State Department did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Jean Foschetti, a program officer at the FPC who was mentioned in the email exchange, referred Fox News Digital to the agency's communications office.\n\n\"The American public may be shocked but, unfortunately, not surprised to learn their taxpayer funds are being used to promote climate alarmism around the world,\" Michael Chamberlain, director of the PPT, told Fox News Digital. \"The State Department should come clean about which foreign publications, articles, and authors they are forcing American taxpayers to fund.\"\n\n\"However, one thing Protect the Public’s Trust has learned from this FOIA request is that transparency is not one of State’s strengths,\" Chamberlain said. \"The more that is revealed the more it becomes clear why the American public’s trust in its government continues its rapid collapse.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe FPC, which is an agency within the Bureau of Global Public Affairs, was founded in the 1940s to \"deepen global understanding of U.S. policy, society, culture, and values through engagement with foreign media.\" The climate reporting tour was the agency's second-ever event of its kind.\n\nMeanwhile, since President Biden took office, the State Department has boosted its diplomatic efforts related to climate change. Among Biden's first actions in January 2021 was to appoint Kerry to be the SPEC, a State Department role that gives Kerry a seat on the president's Cabinet and National Security Council, but didn't require a Senate confirmation process.\n\nSince then, Kerry has traveled across the world, attending high-profile climate summits and diplomatic engagements in an effort to push a global transition from fossil fuels to green energy alternatives. His office is largely comprised of officials who formerly worked in large environmental organizations and has an estimated $13.9 million annual budget.",

            "content": "In a world in which the SEC charges Kim Kardashian with promoting a crypto brand on Instagram without disclosing she was paid $250,000, we are constantly confronted with instances of celebrities behaving badly.\n\nIn a world in which politicians use crude attacks to build their brand – Marjorie Taylor Greene has already filed impeachment resolutions against President Biden and uses them to raise money – we’ve become inured to a culture of demonization.\n\nThe media have for years helped foster this climate, where only increasingly extreme denunciations break through the static. It was hardly invented by Donald Trump.\n\nBut Trump seized the moment with his mastery of the news cycle, using rallies and Twitter (and now Truth Social) to bash and belittle his political foes, often counterpunching against denunciations by them or the fourth estate. Any Republicans who fought him were labeled RINOs and many were knocked off in primaries, leaving a party in which the former president remains the dominant figure.\n\nWHEN A MAJOR HURRICANE COLLIDES WITH OTHER NEWS, THE STORM PREVAILS\n\nSo dominant, in fact, that a majority of Republicans tell pollsters they believe Trump’s continued claims that the 2020 election was stolen, which much of the rest of the country and the vast majority of the media dismiss as a big lie. The Justice Department’s investigation of the ex-president for taking and withholding classified documents only convinces his supporters that the establishment is out to get him.\n\nTrump has been attacking Mitch McConnell ever since the senator broke with him in the aftermath of the Jan. 6 riot. He has called the Republican leader some version of an \"Old Crow\" so many times that nobody blinks anymore.\n\nSo the man who privately called his own supporters \"f------ crazy,\" according to Maggie Haberman’s book, escalated even more.\n\nHe started out accusing McConnell of approving trillions in Democrat-sponsored bills because \"he hates Donald J. Trump\" or wants to \"take the Country down with him.\" (Perhaps McConnell thought infrastructure, computer chips and helping ailing veterans was a good idea?)\n\n\"He has a DEATH WISH. Must immediately seek help and advise [sic] from his China loving wife, Coco Chow!\"\n\nNow I was more offended by the obvious racist reference to Mitch’s wife Elaine Chao, who was Trump’s own Transportation secretary. Her crime was that she resigned immediately after Jan. 6. Still: Chow?\n\nI didn’t see the death wish part as an attempt to stir up violence, but many people disagree. I viewed it more as Trump trolling one of his favorite targets, and am not sure whether the media should take the bait. Does every over-the-top insult need to be covered?\n\nThe Wall Street Journal’s conservative editorial page, which supported many of his presidential initiatives but has been tough on his post-White House conduct, disagrees:\n\n\"The ‘death wish’ rhetoric is ugly even by Mr. Trump’s standards and deserves to be condemned. Mr. Trump’s apologists claim he merely meant Mr. McConnell has a political death wish, but that isn’t what he wrote. It’s all too easy to imagine some fanatic taking Mr. Trump seriously and literally, and attempting to kill Mr. McConnell. Many supporters took Mr. Trump’s rhetoric about former Vice President Mike Pence all too seriously on Jan. 6.\"\n\nFair point; there are plenty of crazy people out there.\n\nThe editorial doesn’t stop there: \"Five weeks from Election Day, Mr. Trump could be working and spending money to elect a GOP Congress or to help his home state of Florida recover from Hurricane Ian. Instead he’s attacking Mr. McConnell and his wife as part of a personal political vendetta, and putting every Republican candidate on the spot to respond to questions about the Trump rant. Mr. Trump always puts himself first, and with this rhetoric he may put others at genuine risk of harm.\"\n\nEven if he meant political death wish, it’s ambiguous enough that it could be interpreted that way. (McConnell makes a general practice of not commenting on Trump.)\n\nMEDIA DISMISS TRUMP-BACKED NOMINEES AS LOSERS, BUT MANY REMAIN COMPETITIVE\n\nThe New York Times ties the Trump era to a tenfold increase in threats against members of Congress:\n\n\"In Bangor, Maine, an unknown visitor smashed a storm window at Senator Susan Collins’s home.\n\n\"In Seattle, a man who had sent an angry email to Representative Pramila Jayapal repeatedly showed up outside the lawmaker’s house, armed with a semiautomatic handgun and shouting threats and profanities.\"\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF ON THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES\n\nCollins told the paper that \"I wouldn’t be surprised if a senator or House member were killed.\"\n\nThe media were far less concerned when an armed man threatening to kill Brett Kavanaugh traveled to within a block of his Maryland home (before providing the tip that prompted police to arrest him). The Biden administration never explicitly denounced this.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAnd we only have to go back to 2017 to recall the unhinged liberal who shot up a Republican baseball practice in Virginia, seriously wounding GOP Whip Steve Scalise.\n\nSo things are ugly out there. Whatever Trump had in mind with McConnell and Chao, it wasn’t exactly a high-minded appeal to our better angels.\n\nFootnote: Despite granting New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman three lengthy interviews for her book and referring to her as his \"psychiatrist,\" Trump has escalated his rhetoric since \"Confidence Man\" came out.\n\nFirst he called her a \"self-appointed head case\" and a \"creep.\" Now she’s \"Maggot Haberman\" and \"a bad writer with very bad sources!\" Haberman, who engaged in extensive fact-checking with Trump, said in the book she’s accustomed to his alternating cycles of positivity and name-calling.",

            "title": "TUCKER CARLSON: These climate activists are fraudulent",
            "description": "Tucker Carlson weighs in on Pete Buttigieg's apparent hypocrisy on the topic of climate change on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'",
            "content": "We're coming up on the two-year anniversary of the Biden administration, if you can even believe it. It seems like a day. Pete Buttigieg has been there almost the whole time. He was sworn in, in early February of 2021. And when he was, he had high hopes. We looked at the tape today. Though he had no previous experience with transportation, or for that matter, with secretarial work, Buttigieg held up his right hand and swore an oath to Kamala Harris to be the best darn Secretary of Transportation he could be. And he seemed to mean it, but not for long. Sadly, history soon intervened.\n\nJust weeks into the job, Buttigieg discovered that some of the roads he was supposed to be overseeing, the roads he was now secretary of, were in fact racist and not just \"low grade, got drunk and wrote insensitive Facebook post ten years ago\" racist. Not that kind of racism. No. These were hardcore, David Duke-level, nasty old segregationist roads. These were roads that refused to respond to reason and clearly had no intention of changing. And during the 21st century. Some of these roads literally had white stripes painted on them. White stripes. Jim Crow stuff.\n\nButtigieg seemed shocked by the whole thing. They don't have roads like that back in South Bend, Indiana. So for Pete Buttigieg, it was a pivot point. It was one of those moments of profound disillusionment so common to high-minded, young newcomers to Washington, where everything changes in an instant. All your preconceptions washed away. Here he'd sworn an oath to take care of the roads, but learned the hard way that some roads are beyond repair. They are too racist to fix. So Pete Buttigieg embarked on another path. He became one of America's foremost religious leaders.\n\nAs an Episcopalian, it was not an easy transition. Traditionally, members of the clergy believe in God. But Buttigieg had a characteristically clever solution, an approach he had learned during his years as a McKinsey consultant. In place of the concept of an omnipotent, loving God who brings justice to the world, Buttigieg simply substituted the word \"climate.\" Thanks be to climate. \"Our climate who weren't in heaven\" – that kind of thing. And it sounded pretty good. Here's one of his sermons:\n\nWHITE HOUSE TO STUDY RELEASING AEROSOLS INTO THE ATMOSPHERE TO COUNTER CLIMATE CHANGE\n\nALI VELSHI: You talk very openly about being a person of faith. And I want to understand how you connect that to this issue of climate change and our custodianship of the Earth and our moral responsibilities.\n\nPETE BUTTIGIEG: Climate is a moral issue, and this is about stewardship. It is about justice. There's a moment here where we should invite those who are motivated by religious, moral considerations to know that those are some of the things that are at stake in what we're doing to this planet.\n\nSo this was really a milestone in modern Christian theology. Climate, declared Father Buttigieg, is a moral issue. Not a meteorological matter, not even a policy topic. It's a moral issue. Climate is a question that bears directly on the fate of your immortal soul. When you mistreat the climate, you risk damnation. In so much as you have done to the least of these, you have done it to the climate. Big change. You thought it was about the science? Actually, it's about morality.\n\nOkay, Reverend Pete. So you set the terms here. So how's your climate record? That seems like a fair question, given that you've just told us that we will go to hell for our carbon emissions. So let's see how you're doing.\n\nFox News Digital just got a hold of the Reverend Pete's travel schedule, a list of trips he's taken since getting the job at the Transportation Department. And it turns out that Reverend Pete is the Jimmy Swaggart of climate clergy. He was commanding you not to do it the same time he was doing it himself in a very big way, way more than you ever thought of doing it.\n\nReverend Pete has sinned. Oh boy, has he in a dark and very naughty way. In less than two years, Buttigieg has flown private, at taxpayer expense, nearly 20 times. He's jetted to Ohio and Florida and New Hampshire, among other places. In September, Buttigieg took an FAA jet to a Canadian gay rights ceremony to accept an award for his LGBTQ+ advocacy. Something else he's been doing since he gave up on the roads.\n\nAll this has been extremely expensive for you and every other taxpayer. You may recall that Donald Trump's HHS secretary, Tom Price, lost his job for doing exactly the same thing. An outrage – Politico.com drove him out of office.\n\nSo it's expensive. But that's not the real crime. The real crime here is against the climate. It's a sin. It's a moral transgression because none of these planes that Pete Buttigieg was jetting around on were solar-powered. Not a single one ran on a windmill or recycled French fry oil. They were all fossil fueled. All of them. And there is likely no mode of transportation in the history of machines that emits more carbon than private air travel. That would include long trips across India on coal-fired locomotives.\n\nPrivate jet travel stands alone. Private jets emit an average of two tons of carbon dioxide in an hour. Per hour. For perspective, that's 14 times more carbon emissions per passenger than the JetBlue flight you're on, or any other commercial flight. So you might as well start a tire fire to heat your house. That would be better for the atmosphere than what Pete Buttigieg is doing.\n\nTraveling by private jet is literally the last thing that Father Pete should ever do. But we shouldn't be surprised that he's doing it. You may remember that last year, when Pete Buttigieg was busted commuting in a carbon belching SUV, one of the vehicles that destroys the climate, then unloading a bicycle from the back seat for a short, widely photographed ride to the White House. You're seeing that footage on your screen now. Now, that should have been the very first tip that Reverend Pete's sermons and the self-described climate activists who applauded those sermons are all entirely fraudulent.\n\nAnd in fact, they are fraudulent. Roughly half of all emission created by airplanes are emitted by the richest 1% of the population flying private. The great majority of these, Biden voters and big fans of, you guessed it, the Reverend Pete Buttigieg. This year alone, to pick but one among many examples, Steven Spielberg, who said he's \"terrified\" of climate change, emitted over 4400 metric tons of carbon from private jets. How much is that? That's 600 times more emissions than the average person emits in a year. Another climate activist, Taylor Swift, nearly doubled Steven Spielberg's total. 8000 metric tons of CO2 in a year, all of them destroying the planet, rising the seas on a fence against Mother Earth. Now, Taylor Swift justified it by saying, \"Oh, I loan out jet sometimes. Oh, it's okay.\" But it's not okay. Not if you claim to believe in climate change.\n\nA 50-minute flight on a private jet can emit as much carbon as the average person's car does over an entire year. 50 minutes. So imagine what a flight from D.C. to L.A.X. does, or more likely from Hamptons to Aspen. And then imagine thousands and thousands, tens of thousands, of these flights, all carrying people who claim they believe that climate change is, quote, \"existential.\" It's not a mistake. It's intentional. It's a statement and it's quite a statement if you think about it.\n\nIf you're yapping about carbon emissions and climate and then flying private, what you're really doing is hoisting a screaming middle finger to the country, to the plebs below in their SUVs, which you say you plan to ban.\n\nAnd not just in this country. We've got it easy. The economies of entire nations around the world are being destroyed right now in the name of fighting climate change, at the behest of people who fly private. So people are going hungry and freezing to death around the world so that Pete Buttigieg and his friends won't have to walk through the magnetometer at the TSA checkpoint. I don't mean to single out the Reverend Pete. Though he is certainly the most self-righteous of the group. They're all doing it.\n\nIs there a single high level climate activist who doesn't fly private? At the recent climate summit, more than 400 attendees flew in privately, not on JetBlue, in their own planes. Jeff Bezos is one of them. He flew in his private jet. So did Boris Johnson. John Kerry was famously busted flying to a climate summit in Iceland on his personal Gulfstream. But don't worry, he had no choice. He's too important. Watch.\n\nJOHN KERRY: It's the only choice for somebody like me, who is traveling the world, to win this battle. I believe the time it takes me to get somewhere -- I can't sail across the ocean, I have to fly -- to meet with people and get things done.\n\nOh, someone like me. You never heard of Zoom, pal? You should be in jail by your own standards. You're a climate criminal. You're a climate criminal. You should be in prison by your own standards. Not just him. Virtually every recognizable person in American politics and entertainment flies private. Nancy Pelosi flies private. Barack Obama flies private. Leonardo DiCaprio flies private. You know who flies private a lot? Al Gore flies private. Michael Bloomberg. Boy, does he fly private. In a four-year period, the U.N. climate envoy, Mr. Bloomberg, took more than 1700 private flights, burning more than 10,000 metric tons of CO2.\n\nYou could never do that. If you filled your yard with diesel engines and never turned them off, you would not do that. Your car emits less than five metric tons of CO2 a year. So this is meaningful. This is an actual offense against Mother Earth and the climate.\n\nSo you have to wonder what the defenders of climate think of this. What about the climate warriors at Greenpeace and the Sierra Club and the Environmental Defense Fund? Have they noticed this? Not really. Have they scolded their donors for undermining their core message? No, of course not. Katherine Clark, the incoming Democratic Party House Whip, doesn't complain either. She should be because her own child has nightmares about climate change.\n\nKATHERINE CLARK: Let me tell you what it means to me, coming in as a different generation. I remember my middle child waking up with nightmares over concern around climate change.\n\nTUCKER CARLSON: THIS IS THE REALITY ABOUT UKRAINE'S ZELENSKYY\n\nOkay, so you terrorized your own children. You scared the crap out of little kids about climate. So you must be very upset about what Pete Buttigieg is doing to climate by flying private, which is the most destructive thing you can do to climate other than signing off on the sabotage of a Russian natural gas pipeline, which I guess they also did. But who's noticing? But she's not worried about it. Katherine Clark doesn't care and neither do her donors, including the environmental activists who send her all that money. Meanwhile, a lot of young people are very upset about climate. They believe Pete Buttigieg. And you know what they're doing? They're destroying some of the greatest artwork in Western civilization because they want you to know how important the climate is.\n\nPROTESTER: It shows the destructive nature of our addiction to oil. During these times of catastrophic climate, change is needed now more than ever.\n\nPROTESTER 2: What is worth more, art or life? We cannot afford new oil and gas. It is going to take everything we know and love.\n\nSo, groups like that, those thugs, those monsters, the Stalinist mobs, didn't appear out of nowhere. It's not organic, of course. They were whipped into a frenzy by John Kerry and Nancy Pelosi and Pete Buttigieg. Those were their inspiration. But what's interesting is they're destroying the things that are most valuable in our society. Our art, the legacy of our civilization. But you know what they haven't done? They haven't said a single word about Al Gore's personal Gulfstream or John Kerry's or Pete Buttigieg. Well, that's weird, isn't it? They're attacking our civilization's art, but they're not saying anything about the people who are actually destroying the climate.\n\nAnd, you know who else isn't? BlackRock. The ESG score that you keep hearing about? Your flights on private planes have no effect on an ESG score. Really? The \"E\" is for environment, but BlackRock doesn't say a word. Could it be that the climate movement isn't really about the climate or about the environment? Could it be that the climate movement is really about creating a permanent caste system where the people at the top of society, the Brahmins, can do literally whatever they want? Can violate with impunity the standards they impose on others, while endlessly lecturing and oppressing the population that supposedly runs the country, but of course, actually doesn't. Could it be? Oh, it's possible.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWe called Pete Buttigieg's office today and asked how you can justify flying private as the Earth warms and the seas rise. How are you not a climate criminal? Speak slowly so we can understand. Of course, they didn't explain. But the rest of us should impose this as a litmus test going forward. No one who seeks to impose carbon rationing on another human being should ever be allowed to step within 100 yards of a private aircraft. Period. Anyone who claims to be serious about fighting climate change should demand tomorrow morning a federal law against private air travel. Make it illegal. It's that simple. Then, go ahead and fly commercial with everyone else or stay home. What's the argument against that? Well, here's what you do know. Anyone who lectures you about climate and opposes banning private air travel is a total fraud and should be ignored.",

Anyone who claims to be serious about fighting climate change should demand tomorrow morning a federal law against private air travel. Anyone who lectures you about climate and opposes banning private air travel is a total fraud and should be ignored.",

            "description": "Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said he would block President Biden's nomination of Laura Daniel-Davis for a key energy policymaking position over her climate activism.",
            "content": "Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., the chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, announced Friday he will block a key Department of Interior (DOI) nominee from moving forward over her climate activism.\n\nManchin noted that his decision — which effectively kills President Biden's nomination of Laura Daniel-Davis to serve as DOI's assistant secretary for land and minerals management — came in response to an internal agency memo that was leaked last week. The memo showed that Daniel-Davis, who holds a lower position at DOI, signed off on an explicit decision to prioritize climate policies over energy security.\n\n\"Today, I have also decided, as chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, that I will not be moving forward the nomination of Laura Daniel-Davis as assistant secretary of the Department of Interior,\" Manchin wrote in an op-ed for The Houston Chronicle.\n\n\"Daniel-Davis approved higher royalty rates for the Alaskan Cook Inlet sale, which were explicitly designed to decrease fossil energy production at the expense of our energy security,\" he continued. \"Even though I supported her in the past, I cannot, in good conscience, support her or anyone else who will play partisan politics and agree with this misguided and dangerous manipulation of the law.\"\n\nBIDEN ADMIN GIVES TOP ENERGY POST TO CLIMATE ACTIVIST WHO FAILED SENATE CONFIRMATION OVER ETHICS CONCERNS\n\nPresident Biden first nominated Daniel-Davis for the position in June 2021. Since then, she has appeared in two confirmation hearings before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, but has failed two votes for her nomination to be passed to a floor vote.\n\nThe White House announced on Jan. 23 that it would again send the nomination back to the Senate.\n\nBIDEN ADMIN OFFICIAL HIT WITH ETHICS COMPLAINT FOR ROLE IN FEDERAL OIL LEASING PAUSE\n\nDaniel-Davis, who currently serves as principal deputy secretary for land and minerals management, previously served in a leadership position for the National Wildlife Federation, a group that has advocated for far-left climate policies. Senate Republicans have consistently opposed her nomination and expressed concern about her views on energy issues.\n\n\"Laura Daniel-Davis’ nomination should have been pulled over a year ago when she first failed to pass committee,\" Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., told Fox News Digital earlier this week. \"The latest attack on oil and gas is no surprise. The Biden administration, his out of touch nominees and Senate Democrats have long put the cult of climate change ahead of energy security and local communities.\"\n\nOn March 3, a Bureau of Ocean Energy Management memo addressed to Daniel-Davis was leaked, showing that the agency projected energy security would be bolstered if the administration charged lower royalty rates for an offshore oil and gas lease in Alaska.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"While a 16 ⅔ percent royalty may be more likely to facilitate expeditious and orderly development of [offshore] resources and potentially offer greater energy security to residents of the State of Alaska, a reasonable balancing of the environmental and economic factors for the American public favors the maximum 18 ¾ percent royalty for Cook Inlet leases,\" the memo stated.\n\nDaniel-Davis ultimately signed off on the maximum royalty rate option without publicly acknowledging the energy security implications of that decision.\n\nThe memo resulted in a rebuke from Manchin and additional calls from Republicans like Daines for her nomination to be withdrawn.",

The White House has announced it will again send the nomination back to the Senate.

            "description": "John Kerry was slammed for a speech at the World Economic Forum on Tuesday. The U.S. climate envoy praised WEF attendees for their \"almost extraterrestrial\" climate change plan.",
            "content": "Former Secretary of State and current U.S. climate envoy John Kerry turned heads with a speech at the annual World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, in which he called himself and his fellow attendees a \"select group\" with an \"almost extraterrestrial\" plan to save the planet.\n\nCritics reacting to clips of Kerry’s address called it hypocritical and delusional.\n\nKerry gave his remarks before WEF guests Tuesday, speaking in grandiose terms about their plan to save the planet from climate change, which he literally described as out of this world.\n\nWORLD ECONOMIC FORUM CHAIR KLAUS SCHWAB DECLARES ON CHINESE STATE TV: 'CHINA IS A MODEL FOR MANY NATIONS'\n\nHe began by first acknowledging his Davos colleagues as an exclusive group, made up by people who have been uniquely inspired to solve the climate crisis.\n\n\"When you start to think about it, it's pretty extraordinary that we — select group of human beings because of whatever touched us at some point in our lives — are able to sit in a room and come together and actually talk about saving the planet,\" he said.\n\n\"I mean, it's so almost extraterrestrial to think about ‘saving the planet.\" He added, \"If you say that to most people, most people think you're just a crazy tree-hugging, lefty, liberal, you know, do-gooder or whatever and there's no relationship. But really, that's where we are.\"\n\nCanadian psychologist and anti-woke thinker Dr. Jordan Peterson asked Kerry over Twitter, \"Who are you going to sacrifice to save the planet @JohnKerry -- and do you think and how will you ensure that they have any say in the matter?\"\n\nRepublican political strategist Jason D. Meister ripped what he called the hypocrisy of the \"select group,\" asking, \"Ever wonder why globalist elites like @BarackObama & @JohnKerry love spending millions on mansions on the sea shore built within a few feet of sea level if they’re so worried about climate change causing a melting of the polar ice caps and a dramatic rise in sea level?\"\n\nSubstack.com journalist Etana Hecht remarked, \"These people take themselves way too seriously.\"\n\nConservative author Doug Powers ripped Kerry and his colleagues, writing, \"Kerry’s ‘select group of human beings’ are psychotic, delusional, narcissistic, Marxist hypocrites trying to get richer by making everybody else more miserable.\"\n\nRadio host Vince Coglianese responded by hitting the \"villains\" attending WEF alongside Kerry. He wrote, \"All the super villains are there — even Jafar!\"\n\nAnti-green movement activist Larry Behrens blasted Kerry as hypocritical as well, saying, \"It's also this ‘select group’ who gets to fly in private jets while demanding you shell out thousands for an EV. John Kerry is one of the most influential people in the Biden Administration and he's also one of the least accountable. And that's saying a lot for that group.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTimcast.com co-host Luke Rudkowski joked about Kerry’s \"extra-terrestrial comment, saying, \"Ha I always knew they were aliens.\"",

            "content": "One of the greatest gifts we can experience is the relationship between parents and children.\n\nHowever, for some of us, this relationship is filled with deep wounds of resentment, shame and guilt. Sometimes, these wounds are so deep they prevent us from living the life we want. I know this because, for almost 30 years of my life, I put an incredible amount of responsibility and blame for my life on my dad.\n\nI always assumed my dad cared more about money and work than he did being my father. But that wasn't the case. The days he stayed late at the office or was late to pick me up from after-school care were not because he didn't want to spend time with me.\n\nIt was because Dad was doing everything he could to give me a better life than the one he had. I see now that I couldn't have asked for a better gift from him.\n\nAfter being on the brink of suicide induced by years of PTSD from fighting in Iraq with the Marines, a series of supernatural interventions saved my life. My military service and deployments to a war zone were not by accident. I had engaged and often ran away from my enemies long before and after the war within the shadow of my past.\n\nWHY I WROTE MY NEW CHILDREN'S BOOK, ‘I’M SO GLAD YOU WERE BORN'\n\nThat shadow was with my Dad.\n\nAt the beginning of the pandemic, I had an epiphany and realized I was using my anger toward my dad as an excuse for why I wasn’t living the life I wanted. Something had to change, so I turned to prayer for an answer. Surprisingly, the answer appeared in the form of a phone call from my dad asking me to go on a cross-country road trip with him.\n\nThis was not the answer I had been praying for. I wanted to say no, but something told me to go because I might not get this opportunity again.\n\nOur 11-day trip was one for the ages. We slept outside through a Florida downpour, cooked meals on a Coleman stove, and laughed more about our past the more time we spent together.\n\nThe turning point for me to forgive my dad was when he told me about the friends he grew up with in the church. I saw a vulnerability in him that I had never seen before. Expressing the faith and love he had for his brothers in Christ was something he had kept to himself all these years. I now understood my dad as a man who had flaws and imperfections, just like me, and was doing the best he could with what he had at the time.\n\nWHY AMERICA'S MOTTO CAN BE YOUR FAMILY'S MOTTO THIS SCHOOL YEAR, ONE MOM REVEALS\n\nI had held onto such deep resentment because I expected him to be much more than what he was at the time. After hearing his story, I forgave him, accepted him, and began to love him more and understand him at his core. That moment made me proud to be his son, something I never thought in a million years I would ever say.\n\nMany of us still hold our parents responsible for how our lives have turned out. We blame them for why we’re not making enough money or having the relationship we desire. We still blame Mom, for example, for not letting us go to prom because we got a D on our math test or when Dad told us we were making the wrong choice pursuing an art degree in college instead of a business degree.\n\nAll because it's easier for us to blame others for our circumstances than to take ownership of changing them.\n\nOur society underestimates how powerful forgiveness is as a tool for creating the lives we want. We don’t consider the power of apology and the weight that gets lifted.\n\nForgiving Dad and accepting him for who he has also revealed something incredibly life-changing: To forgive him meant forgiving myself.\n\nBut it goes deeper than just forgiving your parents. You must let go of the pain and suffering of the past to create a more vibrant future. You must be at peace with what you cannot change and be responsible for what you can change.\n\nIf you find yourself in a similar situation and need to find a way to forgive your parents, here are a few steps you can take:\n\nYour first step toward change is to embrace what cannot be changed, which is the past. Accepting what happened will allow you to accept what can change in your life.\n\nDefine what type of relationship you want with your parents\n\nPart of embracing change is defining what you want to change. This is especially true with your parents. You cannot change how they are, but you can change how you interact with them.\n\nTake responsibility for your life\n\nYes, your parents raised you and they did the best they could at that time. But at some point, it’s no longer their responsibility for the choices you make. Honestly, that point is now. The moment I took responsibility for my life and removed the blame from my dad was the moment my life changed.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nTwo years later, my life is drastically different. My relationships with my friends and family have improved. I’m in the best physical shape I’ve been in since I was a young Marine. My faith has grown immensely. More importantly, my relationship with my dad is now what I always wanted it to be.\n\nTwo men who are not just father and son but very good friends.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",

            "description": "Fox News host Tucker Carlson gives his take on the radical climate change agenda on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'",
            "content": "Let's enter Fantasyland for a moment. Let's pretend for a sec that our country had a news media that was interested in bringing you the news, not in lecturing you about your moral inferiority (You're so bad) or lying to you in transparently obvious ways (January 6 was an insurrection, guys) or even in forcing you to repeat whatever childish slogan they've come up with this week.\n\nVladimir Putin is a war criminal. OK. Transwomen are women. All right. Say it or else.\n\nLet's imagine we live somewhere completely different in a country where the media felt obligated to tell you what was actually happening in the world and why it matters. What stories would we be talking about right now if we lived in that country?\n\nWell, here are the first two. Earlier this month, Iran and Saudi Arabia, the two most significant powers in the Muslim world, announced that after generations of proxy wars and snarling hostility to one another, they will be resuming diplomatic relations. Peace has broken out between blood enemies. As recently as last year, very few would have thought that could happen, and now it has happened, and it's happened – and here's a significant thing from an American perspective – it's happened because China, not the U.S. State Department, but the communist Chinese government brokered the deal. The world's largest atheist state has halted religious conflict between two theocracies.\n\nTEXANS BLAST ELON MUSK'S BORING PLAN TO DUMP WASTEWATER IN LOCAL RIVER: 'THIS IS A HOT MESS'\n\nDid you see that coming? Probably not, but there's more.\n\nYesterday, China's President Xi turned up in Moscow to announce a new partnership with Russia. Going forward, Russia will supply much of China's oil and natural gas. Vladimir Putin also agreed to use Chinese currency in trade with Asia, Africa and Latin America. Once again, holy smokes. As with the Iran-Saudi summit, very few people imagined anything like this could happen just 18 months ago. \"Change that hasn't happened in 100 years,\" Xi said \"is coming, and we are driving this change together.\"\n\nNow, what change was Xi talking about? Well, the end of American global hegemony, the end of the U.S. dollar as the world's reserve currency for 100 years, he got it right. Since the close of the First World War, the United States has been the preeminent nation on Earth. For 40 of those years, we are locked in a Cold War with the Soviet Union, of course. But at no time, no matter what they may have claimed was there ever really a question about who is the most powerful country.\n\nWe were the most powerful country. It was the American era. That era just ended a little over two years into Joe Biden's presidency, but amazingly, no one in this country seemed to notice that it happened. That story is not leading the news tonight.\n\nInstead, we're arguing about whether or not to arrest Donald Trump for a fake crime to keep him from running for president again. Over at the White House our senile president just gave some sort of medal to a sitcom actress, presumably for her bravery. You read the script so boldly. CNN is covering that story like it's the moonwalk. On Twitter, meanwhile, people seem excited that our vice president has sent a letter to a transvestite TikTok star called Dylan Mulvany, who's famous for dressing like a 6-year-old girl. Kamala Harris is very proud of him. That's the news we're getting. It is Weimar, but dumber. Meanwhile, the world beyond Morning Joe is changing faster than any time and, well, as Chairman Xi correctly noted, about 100 years.\n\nNone of these changes will make life better for your grandchildren, but since many Americans don't even know they're happening, the outcry here has been limited to a few insightful but deeply frustrated bloggers and social media. They see clearly what's happening. No one else seems to. It's driving them insane.\n\nThere are still people in this country, for example, who seem to believe that the so-called climate agenda is actually about the or about the environment of the earth or something, and not a coordinated effort by the government of China to hobble the US and the West and take its place as the leader of the world, which of course is exactly what's going on. It's pretty obvious when you think about it, but most people don't get a chance to think about it because the propaganda is just too thick. It's unceasing, it never ends.\n\nHere's the latest on the front page of papers around the country. The head of the United Nations demanding the United States blow up its own economy otherwise, the world will end.\n\nU.N. SECRETARY GENERAL ANTONIO GUTERRES: Humans are responsible for virtually all global heating. Over the last 200 years. The rate of temperature rise in the last half century is the highest in 2,000 years. Concentrations of carbon dioxide are at their highest in at least 2 million years. The climate time bomb is ticking.\n\nWhen someone who knows nothing about science, whose job it is to act as a proxy, a puppet of the Chinese government, starts wagging his finger in your face, claiming scientific expertise and telling you what to do with your economy, at the very least you should pause for a moment. And you should also remember that the United Nations has been saying pretty much the same thing since at least 1989. That's the year that the Associated Press reported that \"A senior U.N. environmental official says entire nations could be wiped off the face of the earth by rising sea levels if the is not reversed by the year 2000.\"\n\nCLIMATE SCIENTIST ECHOES UN WARNING THAT 'HUMANITY IS ON THIN ICE,' SAYS PREVIOUS PREDICTIONS WERE NOT WRONG\n\nThat was 34 years ago. Happy to report we're still here. So, has the science changed? Well, apparently it has not that anyone will acknowledge that, but the shouting remains exactly the same, and the AP doesn't seem to have archives it can check to find out: Have we written the story before? So, they just keep writing the same story.\n\nTwo days ago they wrote this: \"Humanity still has a chance close to the last to prevent the worst of climate change's future harms, a top United Nations panel of scientists said Monday, but doing so requires quickly slashing nearly two thirds of carbon pollution by 2035.\" OK, Associated Press.\n\nThere's even a quote from the U.N. secretary-general, again, not a scientist, a puppet of China, but pretty good at slogans, \"Humanity is on thin ice and that ice is melting fast. \" Are they publishing the same piece and moving the dates around? Not really, actually, because if you read it closely, if you took a look at the UN's entire report, and actually we spent the day doing that, there are big differences in how they plan to solve global warming.\n\nThis time, the plan is much more explicit. Make the West, the United States primarily, but also Western Europe, blow up its own economy, while China, the fastest growing economy in the world, doesn't have to do anything and in fact, they're not doing anything. China is currently building, well, two new coal plants every week, every week. Not good at math, but that's like 104 a year. That's a lot of coal plants. How many are we building a week? Zero. Pretty weird for a country committed to fighting climate change.\n\nWell, the report says that compared to Eastern Asia, North American countries have a 33% greater obligation. How do you measure obligation. Is there a scientific scale for that? But a greater obligation, 30% more, to accelerate spending on \"mitigation investment flows\" to, quote, \"limit global warming.\" OK, the West has an obligation.\n\nNow, if you were to go by like real numbers, you might notice that China's carbon emissions today are more than double our carbon emissions here in the United States. So, we're spewing less carbon, they're spewing a lot more carbon, but we have to spend more because we have a moral obligation, because why? That's not explained.\n\nBut later in the report, the United Nations does say this: \"Actions that prioritize equity, climate justice, social justice and inclusion lead to more sustainable outcomes co-benefits, reduce tradeoffs, support transformative change and advance climate resilient development. Adaptation responses are immediately needed to reduce rising climate risks, especially for the most vulnerable. Equity, inclusion and just transitions are key to progress on adaptation and deep societal ambitions for accelerated migration.\"\n\nCALIFORNIA GOV. NEWSOM STRIKES DEAL TO PUNISH FOSSIL FUEL COMPANIES AFTER FIRST PROPOSAL REJECTED\n\nTry not to use a swear word on TV, but I think we know what that is. It's B.S.\n\nThe report continues. We need \"meaningful participation and inclusive planning informed by cultural values and indigenous knowledge.\" Indigenous knowledge. Now, how much of thar, that's directly from the UN report, how much of that sounded to you, probably not a credential scientist, but a person with common sense. How much of that sounds like science? All of it, says CNN. All of it.\n\nJOHN KING, CNN: Humanity is on thin ice and that ice melting fast. That warning, courtesy of the United Nations secretary general made in tandem with a brand-new United Nations report labeling the planet a ticking time bomb.\n\nBILL WEIR, CNN: It is worse than we ever thought it was going to be and the time is ticking in order to defuse this climate bomb.\n\nDON LEMON, CNN: The climate time bomb is ticking. That's according to the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's report.\n\nWEIR: There's no such thing as climate alarmism anymore. The time bomb is ticking.\n\nJOHN BERMAN, CNN: The new UN report warns the climate timebomb is ticking and the world is running out of time to avoid catastrophe.\n\nThere's no such thing as climate alarmism anymore. Nothing you say can be too extreme. It doesn't matter. That's science. For the Chinese, it's just so easy. How do you win a war without fighting? By getting your adversary to kill himself. How do you convince a strong, self-respecting, powerful country like ours that has ruled the world for a hundred years to do that? It turns out it's pretty easy. You take a collection of dumb, desperate people in middle-age hoping to keep onto their stupid TV jobs, you add scripts and some hairspray and they just repeat the lies for you and then all the people in the country nod: Yeah, that's exactly right. We got to do that. Respect indigenous knowledge. Stop driving our cars.\n\nAnd the amazing thing, it's kind of working. So, what exactly is the science behind all this? Well, on Substack actual scientists now reside, a political scientist called Roger Pielke did a deep dive on where these people got the idea that the world will end if temperatures jump 1.5 degrees Celsius. That's the globally accepted goal, according to the AP.\n\nWell, it turns out that globally accepted goal originated in a newspaper advertisement and a draft paper that was not even peer reviewed. Now it's in the Paris Climate Agreement. That's the power of marketing. But what's the point? What's the point of the marketing? It's to destroy one civilization, to be supplanted by the next civilization. Unfortunately, we're in the one being destroyed, or that is destroying itself. And no one at the UN, by the way, cares about the data where it came from, because the real goal has nothing to do with the environment.\n\nOf course. Duh. Look at the pollution. If you cared about the environment, this is a tough time to live, but ever since Julian Huxley took over UNESCO the 1940 is pushing Malthusianism, the idea that the world's overpopulated, has been the dominant way of thinking for the people in charge except with respect to their own families. They have as many kids as they want, but you're not allowed to. And that leads to moments like the one we saw a month ago where the Harvard historian Naomi Oreskes wrote an op-ed in Scientific American entitled \"8 Billion People in the World is a Crisis, not an Achievement.\"\n\nWell, if you're one of those 8 billion, that seems like hostility. If some chick is writing a piece in a science magazine about how your existence is bad, that might make you nervous, right? It should and it may explain why these people oppose nuclear energy, which seems like a solution, but they're against that, too.\n\nSo, it's not really about carbon emissions, is it? It's about hurting people, specific people. They think there are too many people and this view is very widespread. It's why the leaders, the Democratic Party, are always in your face telling you to get an abortion. Hurry up and get an abortion. It'll help the GDP. It doesn't hurt, of course, that getting rid of fossil fuels would mean a lot of Democratic Party leaders will get a lot richer. Their donors, certainly will – the ones in the renewable industry. It also means a ton of money for people with no skills at all, like Jen Granholm was now the energy secretary who owns stock in these green energy companies while she was in office. It's so corrupt. It's unbelievable and they're in your face.\n\nThere's no such thing as climate alarmism. Shut up and accept it. This would explain why Joe Biden campaigned on ending fossil fuels and bringing about economic devastation for millions of Americans back in 2020.\n\nREPORTER: Would there be any place for fossil fuels, including coal and fracking, in a Biden administration?\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: No. We would work it out. We would make sure it's eliminated and no more subsidies for either one of those, either any fossil fuel. No more subsidies for fossil fuel industry, no more drilling on federal lands. No more drilling, including offshore, no ability for the oil industry to continue to drill. Period.\n\nBIDEN: But I want you to look in my eyes. I guarantee you, I guarantee you, we're going to end fossil fuel, and I am not going to cooperate, OK?\n\nImagine living under the rule of people like that. Imagine living in a system where we with a straight face, ask someone who's never had a real job in his entire life, who has no idea where electricity comes from, probably can't even change a light bulb at this point, about our energy policy and then taking his answer seriously.\n\nAnd what do you get when you do that? Apparently, we GET 81 million votes. He got more than Obama. Really? Shut up and accept it.\n\nWell, the result is now our Strategic Petroleum Reserve, maybe the most valuable thing the United States government owns, is depleted and Russia, which we say we hate, is now once again one of the most important energy suppliers in the world. Meanwhile, your energy prices went up at double the rate of inflation last year. So, what are we looking at here? Well, there are people with economic agendas benefiting from solar panels and the wind farms that kill endangered species. And they're the illiterate cultists in academia who are just for this because they're for it.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAs if to prove that point, Greta Thunberg could just delete your tweet from five years ago saying the world is going to end in five years is about to get an honorary degree from the University of Helsinki. This is a girl who made a living by not attending school. So, what's the degree in? It's not science, not , it's theology.\n\nBut the real agenda, of course, is much bigger than any of that. It's the great global reshuffling that is going on now beneath the notice of most Americans. We're going to wake up one day and realize we're not in charge, and this is part of the reason.",

It also looks at how China's President Xi announced a new partnership with Russia, while Russia will supply much of China's oil and natural gas. Finally, it looks at why the United States was once the most powerful country, and how it has been since the close of the First World War. Finally it looks back on the Cold War era, when it ended with the United Nations demanding the U.S. dollar as the world's reserve currency for 100 years. This article concludes that people still believe in the government's efforts to hobble the West.",

            "content": "U.S. Climate Envoy John Kerry told the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday that the fight against climate change will only succeed if people around the world take on a wartime footing and accelerate action to curb carbon emissions.\n\nWhen asked if the world will meet the shared goal of limiting the global temperature increase to 1.5 Celsius by 2032, he said that target won’t be met given the current amount of effort being made.\n\n\"We can’t hit 1.5,\" he said. \"We’re not on track to do it now, and it’s not clear, absolutely clear that we will get on track.\",\n\nJOHN KERRY APPLAUDS FELLOW DAVOS ATTENDEES AS ‘EXTRATERRESTRIAL’ FOR WANTING TO SAVE THE PLANET\n\n\"We have to right now be deploying the largest solar field in the world, every day, for the next years in order hit the 1.5,\" he added. \"We have to be deploying renewables six times faster than we are today.\"\n\n\"We can do this, but there is not yet the kind of commitment, broadly, that is necessary to make it happen,\" Kerry said.\n\nHe said much more \"collective will\" is needed \"as if we were at war and ready to turn factories into solar panel producers. I think some of that is what we need.\"\n\nWORLD ECONOMIC FORUM CHAIR KLAUS SCHWAB DECLARES ON CHINESE STATE TV: 'CHINA IS A MODEL FOR MANY NATIONS'\n\nKerry told the World Economic Forum on Tuesday that another key to fighting climate change is \"money, money, money, money, money, money, money.\" On Wednesday, he said governments need to find a way to encourage investment in green technology companies even when they are \"slightly riskier.\"\n\nBut Kerry said government can only do so much, and that it’s time to lean on private companies to fund the green revolution. He said even the Inflation Reduction Act, which promised hundreds of billions to fight climate change, isn’t enough.\n\n\"All of us need to be doing even more,\" he said. \"Frankly, we wanted to do more than what we’ve already done in the Inflation [Reduction] Act, which is extraordinary. President Biden started at $1 trillion plus.\"\n\n\"No government is going to solve this problem,\" he added. \"Let’s understand that. No government has enough money to plug those trillions and do what we have to do. So like it or not, we must find a way to create the incentives that bring the private sector to the table.\"\n\nHe said another key is getting governments to speed up decisions to allow for the installation of green infrastructure.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"We don’t have time to do business as usual,\" he said. \"You cannot take 10 years with endless litigation to decide whether or not you’re going to deploy a wind farm in a place where it obviously makes sense and where other people are deploying.\"",

            "content": "Climate activists are planning to disrupt this year's annual Congressional Baseball Game.\n\nIn a new video posted to social media, the Now or Never collective said that Congress has \"one last shot\" to pass historic climate legislation.\n\n\"It's time to leave everything on the field,\" it wrote.\n\nIf politicians have \"failed to deliver,\" the group said it would shut down the game.\n\nTHIS JULY 4TH, COVID IS STILL KILLING HUNDREDS OF AMERICANS EACH DAY\n\n\"We will not stand by, watching them play baseball while the world burns,\" Now or Never said.\n\nOn its website, the organization said that Democratic leaders are failing the American people on climate, calling this summer \"the bottom of the ninth.\"\n\nNow or Never is choosing to engage in direct action, it noted, because \"conventional tactics are not enough\" and it is \"time to escalate.\"\n\nShould lawmakers reach a deal on a climate spending bill, it said it would still take action to demand further legislation but may use a \"more conciliatory tactic.\"\n\nThis move is also about President Biden, whom Now or Never labeled a \"failed president.\"\n\n\"If Biden fails to deliver on climate, he should not be the Democratic nominee in 2024. Full stop,\" the group wrote.\n\nBut, the July 28 game isn't the only day on the Now or Never calendar.\n\nIf there is no strong climate legislation by Aug. 5, Now or Never will protest the DNC and \"see to it that Democratic senators hear from [them] when they fly home empty-handed.\"\n\nSept. 30 is being called the \"last stand.\"\n\n\"If no major climate legislation has passed by this date, we will organize a highly disruptive, mass direct action that fundamentally disrupts business-as-usual in D.C.,\" the group wrote.\n\nClimate legislation was in Biden's Build Back Better plan.\n\nJamie DeMarco, the federal policy director for Chesapeake Climate Action Network, told the Washington Post on Tuesday that two sponsors of this year's baseball game include oil companies BP and Chevron.\n\nThe Congressional Baseball Game has been held since 1909.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nNotably, in June, House Republican Whip Steve Scalise marked the five-year anniversary of the 2017 shooting at a congressional baseball game practice.\n\n\"[Five] years ago today, a leftist came to the baseball field to kill Republican Members of Congress. We'd be dead if not for heroic police officers. Sadly we're still seeing leftist violence 5 years later as they target Supreme Court Justices in their homes. It must be called out,\" he tweeted.",

            "description": "Fox News host Tucker Carlson calls out the left's new cultish climate religion and voices his concerns over some extreme ideas on \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\"",
            "content": "You may remember a writer called Michael Crichton. He was a force in American entertainment. He was a novelist. He was a movie producer. Turned out a ton of top films and bestselling books: \"The Andromeda Strain,\" \"Jurassic Park,\" etc., but he was also — and this is less remembered — a political philosopher and a very wise one. Twenty years ago, before he died, Michael Crichton delivered a talk in San Francisco about the climate crisis and he described in that speech as the religion — not a political movement, a religion — for urban atheists, for people who rejected every aspect of Judaism and Christianity.\n\nClimate activists had, without saying so out loud, created a religion, all the features you would recognize in any conventional religion. They had their Eden, which would be the world before the settlers arrived. They would have their original sin because every religion has that. In their case, it would be the Industrial Revolution and because of that original sin, they believed a rapture was coming, an end of times, and in their telling, the end of times was climate catastrophe.\n\nThe only way to save yourself from this rapture, from this end of times, was to renounce your energy sins and embrace climate activism. So, Crichton identified this as a sign that religious beliefs are inherent. Everyone has them, even atheists. You may not worship God, but you're going to worship something and that's true. Well, not many political theories age well even over 20 years, but Michael Crichton's has.\n\nAs church attendance and self-identified religious faith have fallen off a cliff in this country, the cult of climate has grown even stronger. Now, even the president United States is warning that the world is ending. Unless we pass the Green New Deal and legalize abortion 'til the moment of birth, Joe Biden says climate change will destroy the world. You'd better pass the Democratic Party's agenda. If you don't, you are joining \"the single most existential threat to humanity you've ever faced, including nuclear weapons. It's Code Red!\"\n\nBIDEN ADMIN CRACKS DOWN ON WASHERS, FRIDGES IN LATEST CLIMATE ACTION: 'OVERREGULATION ON STEROIDS'\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: That's what climate change is about. It is literally, not figuratively, a clear and present danger. The health of our citizens and our communities is literally at stake. The UN’s leading international climate scientists call the latest climate report nothing less than \"code red\" for humanity. Let me say it again — \"code red\" for humanity… Making the largest investment ever: $2.3 billion to help communities across the country build infrastructure that's designed to withstand the full range of disasters we've been seeing up to today: extreme heat, drought, flooding, hurricanes, tornadoes.\n\nSo that's not science. That's theology, but it's also politics. You'll note that Joe Biden said we're spending $2.3 billion to fix it, to \"help communities build infrastructure to withstand disasters.\" OK, $2.3 billion. Where did all that money go? No one ever asked. Well, it turns out a lot of it went to something called the Justice 40 Initiative. It's called the Justice 40 Initiative because 40% of the money, tax dollars, goes toward combating something called environmental racism in disadvantaged communities, meaning predominantly Latinx, indigenous and African-American neighborhoods.\n\nIn other words, this is yet more federal funding that excludes the majority of the population based on their race. That's fully illegal. That is a crime under civil rights law, which you all agree is good. Federal courts are already blocked other efforts by the Biden administration to do this kind of thing, but this effort slipped through. Why? Because it's climate. Now, you'd think the DOJ Civil Rights Division would notice if we're spending hundreds of millions of dollars in a racially exclusive way against federal law, but the attorney general of the United States has no problem with it because the climate cult demands it.\n\nBIDEN APPEARS TO GO OFF SCRIPT TO SAY US NEEDS OIL, GAS DRILLING\n\nMERRICK GARLAND: Consistent with the president's executive order on tackling the climate crisis at home and abroad, we are issuing a comprehensive environmental justice enforcement strategy. Communities of color, indigenous communities and low-income communities often bear the brunt of the harm caused by environmental crime, pollution and climate change.\n\nSo, of course, there's no science or data behind any of those claims. They're political slogans. They're completely made up. They're not real, but it's happening anyway. So, we're directing natural disaster aid on the basis of skin color. That's insane. Are hurricanes racist? I mean, hurricanes may be bad, but are they racist? Well, the media tells us, yes, they are racist.\n\n\"CNN TONIGHT\": Decades ago it used to be one or two a season. What happened now with climate change in these extreme warm waters, it's almost, you know, it's happening all the time.\n\n\"MSNBC REPORTS\": This storm, in a way, is kind of bad news for the people that are still trying to deny climate change as a factor.\n\n\"THE 11TH HOUR WITH STEPHANIE RUHLE\"/MSNBC: Florida Republicans deny climate change as a monster storm barrels toward the coast.\n\n\"THE LEAD\"/CNN: This will be a first-time test for how you adapt to these new, stronger storms on a warmer planet as a result of climate change.\n\n\"ALL IN WITH CHRIS HAYES\"/MSNBC: The threat exacerbated, of course, by climate change.\n\nMSNBC: Charleston, like Miami, gets water that comes up on a good sunny day. That's because water levels are rising.\n\n\"THE REID OUT\"/MSNBC: Our earth is getting warmer and there is just no doubt, I think, left that it is feeding these beasts.\n\nYou just saw, like, eight people in a row who know nothing about anything. None of those people are scientists or meteorologists or even effective weathermen. They're political actors and they're making it up and we know that because it turns out people keep track of hurricanes. There are lists of hurricanes so we know there has been no increase, no increase in hurricane frequency, in the United States from 1900 to 2020, 120 years.\n\nBILL GATES' DEFENSE OF FLYING PRIVATE ECHOES JOHN KERRY EXCUSE FOR JET-SETTING AROUND WORLD\n\nIn fact, the number of hurricanes has actually declined over the last century. In that same period, deaths from hurricanes and other natural disasters have dropped by 90%. Really? It's a bigger threat now? Deaths aren’t up by 90%. So, maybe the goal isn't to save human life. Maybe the goal is not to save the environment, which may be the main reason all the climate solutions destroy the environment, but whatever. Ignore the facts.\n\nIn fact, the most accurate forecast suggests that hurricanes will become 25% less frequent going forward. Those are the data. No one cares about data anymore. We saw that with COVID as well. \"Wear a cloth mask,\" said Fauci, even as he privately admitted that cloth masks are useless to prevent the transmission of COVID. \"Take the COVID shot,\" Kathy Hochul told us, standing in a pulpit because, and we're quoting, \"That's what God wants.\"\n\nSo once again, whatever this is, it is not science, by definition. It's religion, but despite the fact the Constitution prohibits the U.S. government from having a state religion, that now is our state religion and it's also the religion of the media and the public health industry, which has grown dramatically over the past three years.\n\nSo, what happens next? Well, as it happens, we have some reference points that give us clues. Whenever you have a religious movement with no God at the center, you have disaster. That's what Marxism was. Zealots want to punish people in the name of their faith. That's always been true. It happens around the world still. Shiite Muslims regularly flagellate themselves all over the world in Iraq, Bangladesh, Afghanistan to commemorate the death of Muhammad's grandson.\n\nAt least that's a real religion, time-tested over a thousand years. Catholics in the Philippines sometimes flagellate themselves on Easter weekend as a form of atonement. They take their shirts and shoes off and whip themselves. You're seeing that right now. So clearly, this is a human impulse. Around the world, people self-flagellate in the name of religious faith.\n\nIn India, Hindu yogis pierce their cheeks and run spikes through their faces. This is pretty graphic, but it happens. These are people of faith. We're not criticizing them. We're just saying this is a feature of religion, but at least there's a God at the center of it. In the United States, there is no God at the center of it. So, what does that mean? It means you're about to be severely punished in the name of someone else's crackpot climate religion. For example, the next time you go to the hospital for surgery, the doctor could very well tell you they can't really give you anesthesia, will tell you it's necessary to pull back on the painkillers in the name of climate. We're not making this up, by the way.\n\nDoctors at the Henry Ford Health System in Michigan are now proposing to cut their carbon footprint by a 10th of a percent by reducing the amount of anesthesia they give to patients. For real! You wheel in there for an appendectomy or any kind of medical procedure and you're really going to suffer because the climate god demands it. How far away from the Mayan or Aztec system? Not as far as we think.\n\nThere's one physician in that system who put it: \"For a long time there was a notion that the greenhouse effect caused in health care settings was an inevitable and unavoidable cost of providing patient care, but we have learned that reducing anesthetic gas flow is one of the many ways health care can lessen its contribution to the global warming crisis.\"\n\nTOP BIDEN ADMIN OFFICIAL'S HUSBAND IS CEO OF, HAS $25 MILLION STAKE IN GREEN ENERGY FINANCING FIRM\n\nThink about that for a second. If you were trying to reduce your carbon footprint, if you really believe carbon was the main poison in our environment, which of course it's not, but if you thought it was, getting rid of anesthesia or reducing the amount of painkillers you give to people while cutting them with scalpels would probably be the last thing you would do.\n\nA decade ago, researchers in Germany suggested that reducing the amount of anesthesia given to patients would lower greenhouse gas emissions to protect the ozone layer. So, that was 10 years ago and at the time, the idea didn't catch on right away because it's insane and it dramatically increases human suffering, which we try to reduce because this is civilization, after all, but as civilization recedes, 10 years later, hospitals in the U.S. are suddenly deciding, \"Wow, that's a great idea. Make people suffer more? Atone for their climate sins? We're on board.\"\n\nSo, the question is, again, referring back to the primitive religions that dominated this earth until pretty recently, the Mayans, the Aztecs and every other human sacrifice–oriented religion, how long until these hospitals decide that the best way to reduce their carbon footprint is to make their patients go to sleep permanently? That's happening in Canada. The government of Canada has killed thousands and thousands of its own citizens, thousands of them.\n\nWere of those people part of it? I don't know, but in the end, false religions wind up killing people. If you're thinking yourself, \"Well, I just won't go to the hospital in Germany or Detroit,\" that's not going to work because it's not the specific solution that they're proposing. It's the way they think and this kind of thinking is everywhere now. It's not just in hospitals trying to reduce greenhouse emissions. Joe Biden's EPA just announced a plan to \"eliminate nearly all greenhouse gas emissions from transportation by 2050.\"\n\nReally? How are you going to do that? Since these people know nothing about energy or engineering, they don't know anything about anything. So, their solutions are not likely to improve life here. Their new idea is to reduce so-called commuting miles through, and we're quoting now, \"an increase in remote work and virtual engagements.\" In other words, they want you to stay inside your house and not have physical contact with other people, and while you're stuck inside your house in the name of protecting the environment, don't even think about using your gas stove or your fireplace or your woodstove or heating the place.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSo, what they're doing since the COVID lockdowns are over, is continuing to encourage employers to keep their employees at home, to isolate people in their little pods, make them powerless, and they're not doing this because it's good for the economy. Obviously, it's not good for the economy. They're doing it because their religion demands it. It makes you look at that FAA meltdown a few weeks ago in a brand-new light. What was that really about?\n\nSo, you're not allowed to get anesthesia in the hospital and pretty soon you might not be able to go outside to work anymore. What else are you allowed to have the name of the climate crisis? Well, how about no more heat or air conditioning or electricity or cars or wearing leather or eating meat or having children? All are sins against the climate. So, for you, it is insects, tap water and celibacy. That's a tough religion. Even John the Baptist got to eat honey and locusts. No more honey for you. We're beyond self-denial. We're in the next phase.",

Unless we pass the Green New Deal and legalize abortion 'til the moment of birth, Joe Biden says climate change will destroy the world. That's what climate change is about. Communities of color, indigenous communities and low-income communities often bear the brunt of the harm caused by environmental crime, pollution and climate change.",

            "content": "A pair of climate activists in Scotland will face trial after allegedly vandalizing a display case holding national hero William Wallace’s broadsword.\n\n\"The police say the accused believe they were raising awareness of climate change and that their actions were necessary for the cause,\" prosecutor Eilidh Smith said.\n\nAlexander Cloudley, 29 and Katrielle Chan, 21, both from Glasgow, pleaded not guilty to vandalism in Stirling Sheriff Court last week. They allegedly damaged and spray-painted the case holding Wallace of \"Braveheart\" fame’s sword.\n\nThey each face a single charge alleging that, on March 2, they entered the National Wallace Monument and \"willfully or recklessly destroyed or damaged property belonging to another\" by \"repeatedly striking a glass display cabinet with mallets and chisels.\"\n\nBIDEN'S CLEAN ENERGY CZAR PODESTA SAYS CHINESE COMPANIES WILL BE ‘BIG PLAYERS’ IN FUTURE US ENERGY PRODUCTION\n\nThe activists also allegedly spray-painted the case with \"This is Rigged,\" the name of their protest group, The Scotsman reported.\n\nThe Crown court did not oppose bail for the activists, but it did seek to ban them from entering the city of Stirling, where the Wallace monument is located, except to attend court dates.\n\nCloudley and Chan were arrested on site, but Police Scotland said \"inquiries are ongoing\" into the incident.\n\nA post on Instagram, which includes pictures of the suspects allegedly vandalizing the display case, said the group’s intent was to \"continue in civil resistance until our demands are met.\"\n\n\"We demand the Scottish Government vocally oppose all new fossil fuel projects in Scotland and creates a clear transition plan for oil workers,\" the group wrote.\n\nIn a video posted to the group’s page, Chan read a statement after spray-painting the display case, saying, \"One hundred and eleven years ago, suffragettes stood in this very spot to stand up for their rights and freedom, 600 years before William Wallace defended our freedom with this very sword. Now it is time for us to stand up for our rights too.\"\n\nWallace defied the English at a time when Scotland remained subject to its southern neighbor, helping wage the Scottish War of Independence that ultimately resulted in Scotland breaking away — for a time — from English governance.\n\nThe sword on display in his monument is one he allegedly wielded during the Battle of Stirling Bridge in 1297 and the Battle of Falkirk in 1298, according to Artnet News. The story inspired Mel Gibson to make the Academy Award-winning movie \"Braveheart,\" which won the Oscar for Best Picture in 1996.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nClimate protests in Britain have targeted a number of culturally significant artifacts and pieces, including a famous incident last year in which anti-oil environmentalists poured tomato soup on Vincent van Gogh’s \"Sunflowers\" painting at London’s National Gallery.\n\nProtesters from \"Just Stop Oil\" also glued themselves to the frame of a famous John Constable painting hanging in Britain’s National Gallery in June.",

The Crown court did not oppose bail for the activists, but it did seek to ban them from entering the city of Stirling, where the Wallace monument is located, except to attend court dates. The group's intent is to \"continue in civil resistance until our demands are met\" and demand the Scottish Government vocally oppose all new fossil fuel projects in Scotland.",

            "description": "New York Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez released a climate change documentary that flopped upon its theatrical release recently.",
            "content": "The disastrous performance of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's climate change documentary at the box office over the weekend reminded her critics of one thing: She doesn't do her actual job in Congress.\n\nAOC enjoys all the perks of her job. She attends flashy galas, is on magazine covers, has done multiple friendly interviews and now has helped produce a film, \"To the End,\" co-host Greg Gutfeld pointed out Tuesday on \"The Five.\"\n\nBut AOC accomplishes nothing in Congress, and Gutfeld said it's \"no surprise\" her film flopped, generating only $80 per theater.\n\n\"Who would go see a movie that's the opposite of entertaining. There's nothing entertaining about that. … But it does show you how great it is to be a progressive in a liberal, biased culture,\" he said. \"She really doesn't do her job, right. She makes movies, she goes to galas. She sits for glossy, butt-kissing interviews in GQ and other women's mags.\"\n\nBEN CARSON REACTS TO NAME BEING REMOVED FROM DETROIT HIGH SCHOOL\n\nCo-host Jesse Watters remarked Ocasio-Cortez is seen hiking in the film, pointing out he has never seen her engage as much with the outdoors in real life – adding that her popularity appears to be tied more to politics as opposed to \"real life\" given her film's paltry revenue.\n\n\"Would I go to it? No. Have I seen it? No. Will I talk about it? Yes,\" he said.\n\nWHY THE LOCKERBIE SUSPECT'S PROSECUTION WAS ‘VERY PERSONAL’ TO BILL BARR\n\n\"This is what politicians often get confused about: Just because you're popular in politics doesn't mean you're popular anywhere else. In fact, usually people that can't do anything anywhere else go into politics to succeed. And she found out that the hard way…\"\n\nWatters said the hiking scenes gives some \"fraudulen[ce]\" to the film, quipping that AOC grew up in the Westchester and represents the outer boroughs of Queens and the Bronx.\n\nBIDEN-CHINA DEVELOPMENTS SHOW NEW GOP MAJORITY MUST PROBE FOR OFFSHORE ACCOUNTS: SCHWEIZER\n\n\"I have never seen [that]. And she showcases her whole life on social media -- You can never see her in private,\" he said. \"Everything is on social media. I've never seen her hike before, but the one time she does a documentary about the environment, she's out there doing the Appalachian Trail: I'm not buying it.\"\n\nJudge Jeanine Pirro, who once represented Westchester as its Republican district attorney, said AOC's film is \"cringeworthy.\"\n\n\"To the End\" was filmed over the course of four years and follows four young women, Ocasio-Cortez, activist Varshini Prakash, climate policy writer Rhiana Gunn-Wright and political strategist Alexandra Rojas, as they attempt to pass sweeping climate change legislation in Congress.\n\nCLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe film currently boasts an 88% \"fresh\" critic score on Rotten Tomatoes and does not yet have an audience score.",

            "description": "The New York Times published a guest essay by Andreas Malm, a radical climate zealot who has advocated for violence and blowing up pipelines in order to stop climate change.",
            "content": "The New York Times published a guest essay Thursday by radial environmentalist Andreas Malm defending climate change protesters who defiled a Vincent van Gogh painting with tomato soup at the National Gallery in London earlier this month.\n\nMalm is the author of \"How to Blow Up a Pipeline: Learning to Fight in a World on Fire,\" a book that advocates for ecoterrorism and criticizes pacifism among the more peaceful climate activists.\n\n\"As a rule, I tend to think sabotage is most effective when it is precise and gritty,\" Malm wrote in the New York Times essay.\n\nHe praised Just Stop Oil, the painting protesters' group, for how they \"smashed gas stations in April this year,\" saying for that action, \"they hit the nail on the head. Gasoline, unlike a van Gogh painting, is a fuel of global warming\" which \"must be shut down to save humanity and other life-forms.\"\n\nMSNBC, NEW YORK TIMES, ‘THE VIEW’ PANIC THAT VOTERS CARE MORE ABOUT ECONOMY THAN ‘THREATS TO DEMOCRACY’\n\nMalm said that while he was first skeptical of the effectiveness of the group switching from attacking gas stations to priceless works of art, he has since changed his mind.\n\n\"There might be room for this kind of action, too,\" he wrote.\n\n\"By doing something so scandalous, Just Stop Oil forced media and the wider public to pay attention‌ to the fact that the British government is about to hand out 100 ‌‌licenses for new oil and gas projects when ‌there cannot ‌be a single one more,\" he continued.\n\nEurope is experiencing devastating energy shortages amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine and policy leaders' decision to transfer away from oil and gas and toward alternative sources of power. Inflation in the United Kingdom is at a forty-year high amid rising food and energy costs.\n\n\"The climate movement in the Global North seems to be reading its history. In the past year, activists have been taking up the tactic of sabotage and property destruction along a spectrum from symbolic to serious,\" Malm said, after favorably compared their actions to those of British suffragists.\n\nHe wrote that so-called \"leading energy scholars\" at Boston University \"are discussing the pros and cons of climate militancy and coming down, remarkably, in favor of considering a full range of options, including civil disobedience and guerrilla warfare.\"\n\nWhile noting it was important to \"make sure that no one is physically harmed in the process,\" he justified extreme action, saying, \"As for the ethics of property destruction, it is not, in this case, very complicated. Fossil fuels kill people. If you disrupt the flow of such fuels and damage the machinery they impel, you prevent deaths. You stop the perpetration of harm.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMalm concluded, \"We don’t know what, if anything, will work, which is why, perhaps, the movement needs both: flippant attention grabbing as well as surgical shutdowns, in a diversity of disruptions. We cannot afford to forgo creative methods that might further the cause.\"",

            "content": "An \"intersectional climate scientist\" compared pollution to the \"fart of a dog\" when explaining her approach to thinking about climate change.\n\nA TikToker named Dr. Chandler Puritty who claims to be an \"intersectional climate scientist\" used a metaphor from the book Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone, which includes a three-headed dog guarding a trap door.\n\n\"I am a climate scientist, and I'm here to explain to you why we are definitely going to get this thing under control and why a lot of the narratives that we see predominantly from white men and professionals are so doom and gloom,\" the TikToker said.\n\nASTROPHYSICS 'STEEPED IN SYSTEMIC RACISM AND WHITE SUPREMACY,' SAYS COLORADO COLLEGE SCIENCE PROFESSOR\n\nShe proceeded to state that the three-headed dog Fluffy from the Harry Potter series represents capitalism, colonialism, and white supremacy–all three of which she argued are barriers to solving the climate change issue.\n\n\"Okay, so you have this three-legged dog. The three-head dog. Now the heart of this dog is CO2. Okay. Carbon dioxide. White scientists are telling us that the reason that every time we send someone in to get the Sorcerer's Stone, the cure to climate change, from under the trapdoor is to make the room smell less like farts instead of to get rid of the dog entirely,\" Dr. Puritty said. \"Take it as you will.\"\n\n'GENDER QUEER' AUTHOR DOUBLES DOWN ON EXTREMELY GRAPHIC IMAGES OF SEX ACTS, SAYS IT COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE\n\nThe video on Puritty's TikTok account has over 180,000 views, which have also been shared on Libs of TikTok.\n\nThe Puritty previously made another video claiming that science was subjective.\n\n\"I would often be called out for my takeaways and my ideas saying that I am being subjective. When in reality the fact is we are all being subjective. But white men get to ignore the fact that they are being subjective because they are normal, the baseline--because their subjectivity is normalized,\" she said.\n\nAccording to another report, Puritty is a former Ph.D. candidate in UC San Diego’s biology department and had obtained a teaching position there. In a separate video, Puritty said she didn't grade her students and just gave them all A's.\n\n\"So, since I’m not grading them – I’m just giving them ‘A’s’ – like, how do I know that they’re doing anything, and how do I know that they’re learning anything?\" Puritty asked in the video. \"I run a discussion style classroom, so my students and I have equal part when it comes to bringing information to the table. We all sit together and share what we’re talking about, and they get to use their critical thinking skills to apply the things they learned in all their other classes.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPuritty eventually quit that position, she said in a previous video.\n\nFox News Digital reached out to Puritty but didn't receive a response.",

            "content": "This is a rush transcript from \"Gutfeld!,\" March 28, 2022. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\n\n\nGREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Well, hello there. Great to see you again. Hope you had a great weekend. I know I did. Although the last thing I remember was Larry Kudlow putting on the leather mask. But I remember my childhood when I was a kid, I had a dog named Chipper. It was a miniature schnauzer that looked like a tiny German General with mange. No, think Wolf Blitzer, but with a color.\n\n\n\nThe dog drove me crazy because we lived on a street between a park and a busy street full of fast cars. And whenever the dog got out, you think it would run to the park to pee or poop, you know, like vagrants and Democrat run cities. But no, it always ran up the street towards the traffic. And as kids would have to race after him and risk our lives trying to scoop the mutt out of harm's way was a weird habit.\n\n\n\nWhen offered options to pick the worst one, which seems to be a president's problem. Instead of taking a quiet walk to the park, he just loves to run right into traffic and scream World War III.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nJOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STTAES: We will have a different future, a brighter future, rooted in democracy in principle. Hope in light of decency and dignity and freedom and possibilities. For God's sake, this man cannot remain power.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Yes, hejust said, for God's sake, this man cannot remain in power. And sadly, he wasn't talking about himself. He literally brought up regime change, pushing the war into a new phase where our president just validated exactly what Putin was thinking. He may as well have said, we're nuking Russia next week, unless they do it first. Thanks, Joe. As we inch closer to negotiations, we just took a giant step back.\n\n\n\nIt's like being on the one-yard line and you get a 10-yard penalty for holding. That's baseball, Kat.\n\n\n\nKAT TIMPF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Oh.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Now I thought our policy wasn't to topple Putin. For us toppling regimes has worked out about as well as dating a stripper. At least for the people I dated when I was stripping. Biden threw gas on the fire and it's six bucks a gallon. That's really wasteful. If only someone had warned him.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: I think the one thing he's got to say, this is where my expertise comes in. Stick to one essential truth. The invasion was a clear violation of international law. And don't bring up regime change.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Yes. Who got Brad Pitt to be on \"THE FIVE\"? Oh, that was me. They should change the name of the show to The10, am I right? Because that's what I am. Right, Martha?\n\n\n\nMARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Absolutely. I thought that was Brad Pitt.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Yes, I know. I get that a lot. I look younger. But maybe that's a question only the pope can answer. The funny part, watching the media proclaim how forceful Joe had been in his regime change talk only to watch it get walked back like an escaped prisoner being returned to his cell.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What a powerful speech that we just heard from President Biden there.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: The speech was really, really well done and it touched on several strategic points.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That line there at the end directly to Putin, I think is the standout line from that entire speech, Wolf.\n\n\n\nWOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: Yes. He made it clear, he wants Putin gone.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Certainly critical, certainly the message that he wanted to deliver here tonight. But that call at the end in terms of President Putin, that was something, no question about it.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Obviously, those words this man cannot remain in power. Very, verystrong words.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Yes. So strong. In fact, it had to be erased in a panic. A Biden aide said the president's point was that Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors on the region. He was not discussing Putin's power in Russia or regime change. Sorry. So (INAUDIBLE) forgot to say all of that. Now, it's bad enough, this administration is telling us what we can and can't say. Now they're telling us what we did and we didn't hear.\n\n\n\nHere's Joe trying to walk back his own words.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nBIDEN: I want to make it clear, I wasn't then nor am I now, particularly the policy change. I was expressing more outrage that I feel I make no apologies.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: All right. But that came after something else. He said that was kind of pointless.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nBIDEN: You're in the midst of a fight between democracies and oligarchs? Who's going to prevail? Or democracy is going to prevail on a -- and the values we share? Or autocracies going to prevail? And that's really what's at stake. So, what you're doing is consequential, really consequential.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: OK. How does this matter to the rest of the world? It only matters to us and it doesn't shorten the war. I'd only suggest that the war has a bigger mission for us, like it means more to us than it does to them. But does it? If only someone had warned him about this.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: The invasion was a clear violation of international law. Don't start talking about protecting liberal democracies because places like China and Russia, they don't draw that line. It's not that important to them.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: But they do understand violation of international law. You can't get around that statement.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Who is that sexy beast? Someone should give that guy a late night show. But there were other gaffes.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Sir, deterrence didn't work. What makes you think Vladimir Putin will alter course, based on the action you've taken today?\n\n\n\nBIDEN: Let's get something straight. Do you remember if you covered me from the very beginning, I did not say that, in fact, the sanctions would deter him? Sanctions never deter. You keep talking about that. Sanctions never deter.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Well, then what's their point? Are sanctions, like aroma therapy, where we just pretended works, but it just stinks up the place. And then there's this.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nBIDEN: Ukrainian people have a lot of backbone, people have a lot of guts. And I'm sure you're observing it. And I don't mean just a military.\n\n\n\nAnd you're going to see when you're there. And you -- some of you have been there. You're going to see -- you're going to see women, young people standing the middle of -- in front of a damn tankjust saying, I'm not leaving. I'm holding my ground.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: So, you're going to see me, you're going to see when you're there. Biden puts his foot in his mouth more than a marooned cannibal. Now, maybe no one takes what Joe says seriously, maybe the world leaders see our president like Forrest Gump. They laugh and take advantage of them. But this old dog leaves so many messes on the carpet. If only there was a product that could take care of that once and for all.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nTIMPF: I am so sick of cleaning up these messes. There's got to be a better way.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, then we've got a scoop for you. Introducing the White House pooper-scooper for when the president makes a mess of things. Perfect for when your boss is talking (BLEEP)\n\n\n\nBIDEN: For god's sake this man cannot remain power.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Or engaged in pissing contests.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: To clarify on chemical weapons, could if chemical weapons were used in Ukraine, would that trigger a military response from NATO?\n\n\n\nBIDEN: It would trigger response in kind.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: It even works on verbal diarrhea.\n\n\n\nKAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Talking about the significance of the passage of time. Right? The significance of the passage of time. So, when you think about it, there is great significance to the passage of time.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Eighty-one million people can't be wrong. Order yours today. Shipping may take 12 to 14 months due to supply chain issues.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Wearing mask.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: So, the White House saw this trip to Brussels as a way to boost the precedence sagging numbers. So, you had all these photo ops eating pizza with troops, holding a refugee child, thank God there was no hair sniffing. And meeting with other so-called world leaders. But really if you wanted to enhance his status, he's just should have stayed home and dated Pete Davidson. It's sad, Joe's been in politics for over five decades, six if you count his first year as president.\n\n\n\nHe was a V.P. for eight, been to a lot of countries, met all the players and of course knows Ukraine, like the back of Hunter's laptop. But in politics the longer you're in it the dumber and more detached you become. It's the only profession where experience counts against you. And the higher the stakes the more Biden screws up. Look, we know Putin violated international law and follows it with bomb and the crap out of Ukraine.\n\n\n\nSo why help him at home by indulging his fears? It's just like telling Jesse Watters he's losing his hair. It only makes him angrier.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Period.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Let's welcome tonight's guests. In the interest of time, her bio list of people she hasn't interviewed. Anchor of \"THE STORY,\" Martha MacCallum. We call him Scrooge McDuck because he's an expert on money and hates wearing pants. Host of \"KUDLOW\" on Fox Business and former director of the National Economic Council, Larry Kudlow. The only thing she does by the book is stealing from libraries.\n\n\n\nFox News Contributor Kat Timpf. And if Will Smith's slapped him, he'd be getting his Oscar posthumously. My massive psychic and the NWA World Television Champion, Tyrus. Oh, Martha, Martha, Martha, Martha, what is going on with this administration? Should we be worried? Like I feel like they -- I feel like the Ukraine -- you - though, Ukraine, Ukraine wants this to end. But like -- but Biden is just making it last longer by stupidity, or is that just me?\n\n\n\nMACCALLUM: That's just you.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: OK. That's my feeling.\n\n\n\nMACCALLUM: You know, I mean, I think that -- I think that Zelenskyy would love for this to end, although every time they talk about negotiations, they seem to be at absolute opposite sides of the fence. With regard to the president and the things that he says, I think, honestly, he would be better off not walking it back at all and just letting it lie.\n\n\n\nLARRY KUDLOW, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Right.\n\n\n\nMACCALLUM: I mean, you know, no matter what you think of President Trump versus President Biden, you know that President Trump would never have walked back and comment like that. We remember the tweets that he said about the North Korean leader. But I also think that the smarter way to go with this kind of language is more along the lines of what we heard from President Reagan in terms of empowering the people of Russia, and encouraging them to potentially make different choices in the future about their world and about the kind of world that they want to live in.\n\n\n\nThen it's a dig at Putin is sort of saying we recognize the fact that many of the people who live in your country are probably against this war, and are probably against you in what you're doing without calling for regime change. It also reminded me of President Obama who told us time and time again, that Assad's days were numbered.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Yes.\n\n\n\nMACCALLUM: And that he must go. And all across the country, the feeling was, well, this guy, there's no way he's going to last.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Yes.\n\n\n\nMACCALLUM: His days are numbered. But guess what? He's still there. So, those things have a way of sticking around. And you have to be decisive. And if you're going to say something, like he said the other day, you just have to stick by it.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Yes. Larry, what do you make of that saying regime change? I mean, that -- is that a good thing or a bad thing?\n\n\n\nKUDLOW: You know, Biden, who is totally bewildered. He can't say anything right. Yet our troops going into Ukraine. He won't give Zelenskyy the weapons. He's cognitively disabled. It's awful story. He's weak. He's intimidated by Putin. But he said the only good sentence of his entire presidency, OK? Which had a Reagan feel to it. I'll probably be criticized for this. Nobody agrees with me.\n\n\n\nAnd he said it. He said it. You know, I mean, Reagan used to say they when -- they say we win, they lose. Reagan used to say evil. Biden never attacks Putin directly. He never knocks him in the nose like he should. He has called him a war criminal. It was like pulling teeth to get out of it. It was a Fox reporter that got it out of it. He should call him a crook and corrupt because he has $700 million yacht sitting off the coast --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Don't get jealous, Larry.\n\n\n\nKUDLOW: I don't. So, the, you know, Putin robbed the Russian working folks for the last three decades. But Martha's right in some sense. Biden said it, he took a whack at them.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Yes.\n\n\n\nKUDLOW: Stick with it.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Yes.\n\n\n\nKUDLOW: I mean, the people that jumped on Biden the fastest were the people in his own administration.\n\n\n\nMACCALLUM: I know.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Yes. Which is absolutely pathetic.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Who is that by the way? Who is -- who is the person that's doing the jumping? We're trying to figure that out in The Five. We don't know who it is.\n\n\n\nKUDLOW: Well, I mean, ostensibly, it was Antony Blinken. I don't know who started it, but it was Blinken, his secretary of state. I mean, Biden -- look, he took one whack at him. It's the only decent thing Biden said in a year or 14 months. Let it stand. Don't walk it back. Let it stand.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: You know, Kat, given my many years of foreign policy experience going back to the 80s. I would disagree with Mr. Kudlow and saying that if you want to engage in negotiation, you don't demonize the other side. What side do you take? And remember, you work for me.\n\n\n\nTIMPF: I do, which is actually OK. So, for Biden, he's not a guy -- that wasn't in like the prepared speech.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Right.\n\n\n\nTIMPF: I just don't think he's a guy who should be riffing.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: No.\n\n\n\nTIMPF: I just think he shouldn't be riffing. And going back to my job, I think it's the difference between he was just saying, oh, hey, I was just saying how I feel but it's because of who you are that it was such a big deal.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Right.\n\n\n\nTIMPF: So, if I see someone on Twitter who's like, oh, Kat is so annoying, like get rid of a replace. I think she should be replaced. I'm not going to think about it too much. If I heard you say that, that would be a little more concerning to me. Because you could actually do something about that. Just like Biden can actually do something about that. So, that's why -- that's why it matters.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Don't check your voicemail.\n\n\n\nKUDLOW: Can I -- Can I just say one thing --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Yes.\n\n\n\nKUDLOW: Reagan pounded the evil empire, and its dictators and its Politburo czars, and then -- and then not only wound up making a deal that was to his advantage, you wouldn't give up SDI, remember that? And then the Soviet Union fell. Another words, sometimes you got to whack them a bunch of times to show that you at least have some manhood. Biden's problem is he hasn't had any manhood in this whole thing.\n\n\n\nAnd he should be calling Putin a war criminal and a crook on a daily basis. And you might be surprised either this -- either the Russians overthrow them or like take a poll. Do you think -- how many Americans you think agree with Lindsey Graham when he first came out and said Putin should be assassinated? How many? 92 percent, 98 percent, 99 percent. In other words, Biden was on something.\n\n\n\nHis trouble is as Martha said, he should have stuck by it for heaven's sake and soften those guys up.\n\n\n\nMACCALLUM: The Kremlin said they thought it was alarming what he said.\n\n\n\nKUDLOW: Yes. Alarming.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nMACCALLUM: -- alarming, what's going on Mariupol is alarming.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Yes.\n\n\n\nKUDLOW: Yes.\n\n\n\nMACCALLUM: this statement is not alarm -- how dare they say that -- I mean, it's --\n\n\n\nKUDLOW: I love it when you talk like that.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: All right. Last words to you, Tyrus.\n\n\n\nTYRUS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I don't know. I don't know what speech you guys are watching but I guess a lot of speech writers in the pandemic was the biggest class of workers that disappeared I guess. He was talking about points of light and how it was going to be a beautiful thing democracy and then my god man, man, he has to go -- there was nothing connected to that.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Yes.\n\n\n\nTYRUS: Not even a little bit. Whenever he talks, you get about two minutes of cognitive speech and then --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nTYRUS: My God man, and then I'm taking crazy pills or I'm going demand like him. He didn't walk back the regime change. He said policy change.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Yes.\n\n\n\nTYRUS: He wanted to change the voting rights in Russia. He had no clue about what he said. He said policy.\n\n\n\nKUDLOW: Yes.\n\n\n\nTYRUS: He forgot regime.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Yes.\n\n\n\nTYRUS: Regime policy. I get them confused all the time. Tomato, tomato. We in trouble. There's no strong statements from him. All he does is ring dinner bells and enable the other side. And if I was in Taiwan right now, I would start packing up stuff because he just fires everybody up. They're literally on the phone going, you know (INAUDIBLE) did you hear what he just said? Do it. He's empowering the wrong side and makes us look horrible.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Well, wait until we get to this next segment. Oh, you're going to love this. Up next Chris Rock gets hit with an open hand. But was it real or was it planned? Of course it was real.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Ah, there you are. Will Smith in Oscar disgrace because he left his fresh prints on Chris Rock's face. Or is Chris Rock a hater? Because he made a joke about Jada. And was three hours of Oscars crap saved or ruined by Will Smith slap? I speak of course of Smith who slapped Chris Rock at the Oscars over a joke about his wife Jada Pinkett Smith who suffers from alopecia. Once again minorities were hit hardest.\n\n\n\nNow I don't remember when the slap happened. So let's just watch all 3-1/2 hours now. And I'm sure it'll pop up eventually.\n\n\n\nCHRIS ROCK, AMERICAN COMEDIAN: Jada, I love you. G.I. Jane 2. Can't wait to see it. All right? (INAUDIBLE) that was a nice one. OK. I'm out here. Uh- oh. Richard. Oh wow. Wow.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: At first that may have felt like it was staged but then Smith had some words for Rock after he sat back down.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nROCK: Wow. Will Smith just smack the (BLEEP) out of me.\n\n\n\nWILL SMITH, AMERICAN ACTOR: Keep my wife's name out your (BLEEP) mouth.\n\n\n\nROCK: Wow, dude.\n\n\n\nSMITH: Yes.\n\n\n\nROCK: It was a G.I. Jane joke.\n\n\n\nSMITH: Keep my wife's name out your (BLEEP) mouth.\n\n\n\nSMITH: I'm going to. OK? Oh, OK.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: He was going to say something. I want to know what that is. Smith returned to the stage later to accept this award for Best Actor and apologize for the incident but didn't mention Rock.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nSMITH: In this business, you got to be able to have people disrespecting you. And you got to smile and you got pretend like that's OK. I want to apologize to the academy. I want to apologize to my -- all my fellow nominees.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: -- apologize. It was an awesome moment. Anyway, now most of the reaction to the whole thing has been all over the place. But the dumbest take came from CNN analyst Asha Rangappa who tweeted, so did like anyone walk out after that happened? Or are we getting an independent psychological case study on how Trump got normalized? Yes. It was Trump's fault. Of course, expecting Hollywood to walk out over injustice.\n\n\n\nThey make half their money from China. So rich black man smacks another rich black man at the dumbest event on television. So the only possible cause is white people, that's like blaming a hockey brawl on Barack Obama. Except in that case it would be true.\n\n\n\nTIMPF: An idiot would say.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: An idiot would say. All right. You have some strong feelings about this, Tyrus. Take it away.\n\n\n\nTYRUS: Unfortunately, man, this is what happens when you're in a bad relationship. This is -- this is what this is. The -- Chris Rock is a comedian. He made a joke. He started with I love you.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Yes.\n\n\n\nTYRUS: And he made a G.I. Jane joke. Not the worst thing ever to be said to anybody that you're a -- you're a badass woman who kicked ass and all men's military movie by yourself. Jada has always had short hair. And we know about her issue, but it was the laugh. Will Smith laughed at the joke. Everyone see him laugh at the joke.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Right.\n\n\n\nTYRUS: She did not.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Yes.\n\n\n\nTYRUS: She made the face. And then when the camera goes back to Chris where he is going like that. That's the exchange. And that's when the husband who should have been like, it was just a joke, dear. He had to prove to her because that's how bad their relationship was. He goes up he smacks Chris and in my opinion he threw away everything that he stood for in that moment. This brother was one of the -- he was one of the brothers that -- he did a different.\n\n\n\nHe wrapped without cussing. He did everything the right way. He was -- we had Bill Cosby. We know how that ended. He was the one guy who -- his criticism was always, he was soft. He was this, he was that. But he was the guy who did it right. He was the guy who tell you something like, hey, be like him. He did this way. He did it that way. In one moment, he was no different if he was going to be in NWA or any of the controversial groups back in the day, they used to fight against.\n\n\n\nAll because -- it had nothing to do Chris Rock. It had nothing to do anything to do with him and Jada, and their relationship. And I mean, the turntable thing which he talked about. Basically being with the dude in the house and all that stuff. That stuff weighs on you. And when you have a bad relationship, that's what happens. You don't have to be in the academy wars to see it. We've seen at restaurants, bars, all kinds of places where a guy and his wife or his girl will be there, they had a bad relationship.\n\n\n\nSome guy says something like, you know, what are you going to do about it? See? I told you want a man or I'll show you and then walks over and hits the guy because that's their thing. So, they need counseling. And while the woke were just stuck, weren't they?\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Yes.\n\n\n\nTYRUS: They didn't know what to do. A straight black man and another straight black man one slap them. And they were like -- because to them it doesn't matter about violence if it doesn't affect them.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Yes.\n\n\n\nTYRUS: It's about the words. Now if Chris would have been gay and will slapped him. Boy. They'd be asking for the Academy Award back.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: All right.\n\n\n\nTYRUS: They'd be protesting but it's funny when he has not affected you, you really don't care about violence. Me personally, I think we'll should be -- should give the academy one back. He's disgraced himself. He disgraced everything he stood for. And Chris didn't deserve that. Not to mention the message. Next time a comedian says something you don't like and you're just going to walk up and hit him and say, well, He disrespected me.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Yes. Kat, where do you stand on this? I'm sure that you are -- you wish that he had hit him harder.\n\n\n\nTIMPF: I just -- I think it's awful. I can't even believe there's a debate over whether it was OK or not for someone to --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Are you against debate?\n\n\n\nTIMPF: Just for someone to hit? No, I'm not. That's the entire point. For someone to hit a comic. That just the fact that that's acceptable to someone be on his side. Comedians are supposed to push boundaries, they're going to mess up sometimes. And I get it. I know it's I was diagnosed with alopecia when I was 27. I lost a severe amount of hair. Thankfully, I've been able to do things where a lot of it's grown back and it's better now.\n\n\n\nI cried a lot over. I know how devastating that can be even though I never lost all of mine. And it's better. It doesn't matter what the subject of the joke is. It doesn't matter at all. For people say oh, you can hit somebody, that's going to destroy it -- like that's what happens when you have all these people saying for so long words or violence, words or violence? Apparently people are taking it literally.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Larry? Thoughts?\n\n\n\nKUDLOW: I don't know. This whole thing kind of baffles me. It's not exactly my cup of tea. I was really interested in what Tyrus said.\n\n\n\nTIMPF: Yes.\n\n\n\nKUDLOW: I mean, I don't know anything about that. So she -- basically, he was laughing at the joke. But the wife --\n\n\n\nTYRUS: If we -- if we -- we're not -- we can't go back and put it in so much. He didn't laugh. He did this.\n\n\n\nKUDLOW: Yes.\n\n\n\nTYRUS: Like that kind of laugh. And then --\n\n\n\nKUDLOW: So, she turn -- right. She turns to him and said defend me (INAUDIBLE)\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nTYRUS: Look. Watch his face. He does the head back. I'm telling you as a brother. We -- we're emotional with our laughing, that stereotype is true. And when I'm like, haha --\n\n\n\nKUDLOW: I just think --\n\n\n\nTYRUS: Oh, damn.\n\n\n\nKUDLOW: All these words, nobody watches this stuff. Anyways, it was the worst ratings, I think in their history and they're trying to ruin our culture. So, I actually care that much what happened. But it's all very interesting what you did say and I'll respect that and leave it --\n\n\n\nMACCALLUM: (INAUDIBLE) remember when he went up and grabbed the award away --\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: That was the Grammy's, right?\n\n\n\nMACCALLUM: At the Grammy's, right. So that sort of broke that wall. And now you're allowed to I guess go up and react to whatever you want to react to. I thought the joke was dumb. It wasn't funny, first of all. And I -- and it was personal. So, it's like excluding everyone else who's watching and like what's going on and he said mean things about her before and, you know, so it's a classic Hollywood indulgence and I really don't care --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: It's a high school cafeteria.\n\n\n\nMACCALLUM: What is going on between these two guys and why they have to bring it into -- and anyone else who won an award last night it's been completely overshadowed. No one's ever going to talk about it.\n\n\n\nKAT TIMPF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I wouldn't have talked about it either.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: I know. You know what's funny, though, Martha.\n\n\n\nMACCALLUM: No, we wouldn't, that's right.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Nobody knows the movies.\n\n\n\nMACCALLUM: No, I'm sorry -- \"Coda,\" I watched \"Coda.\" It's the only one I watched. It's a nice movie. It's a sweet movie. It tells a good story. Is it a Best Picture?\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Yes.\n\n\n\nMACCALLUM: I don't know. I think this that --\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Everything's gotten smaller with the Oscar. There are no big movie stars. There are no big movies.\n\n\n\nLARRY KUDLOW, FORMER DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL OF THE UNITED STATES: If all these Hollywood people just slug it out. And who's ever, who's ever standing, gets the Oscar?\n\n\n\nTYRUS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: We will be there all day. Did you not see that slap? It's way to fill the NBA fist fight.\n\n\n\nMACCALLUM: I think he should've punched him at the party afterwards, not on stage.\n\n\n\nTIMPF: I agree with you.\n\n\n\nMACCALLUM: If I'm married to him and he goes --\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: We wouldn't have seen it.\n\n\n\nMACCALLUM: Well, but that's the point, that's the point.\n\n\n\nTYRUS: But here's the other thing, how many videos do we have of --\n\n\n\nMACCALLUM: It's not honor, it's just like --\n\n\n\nKUDLOW: Martha, I would've defended you. I would've defended you.\n\n\n\nMACCALLUM: Why don't you slug him at the Vanity Fair party. That'll be awesome.\n\n\n\nKUDLOW: I mean, first of all, he should've hit him in the ribs a couple times.\n\n\n\nTYRUS: Wow, just like, just bang him up. Take your time on stage. Commercial break. Come back\n\n\n\nMACCALLUM: Did Chris Rock go to the parties after? I saw that.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Yes, he did. He did go to -- I think he went to Vanity Fair party. What do I know?\n\n\n\nMACCALLUM: Well, I saw that Will, that Will and (INAUDIBLE) had a great time.\n\n\n\nTYRUS: Like an O.G. and mad respect because he had more to lose than Will did.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Yes, he just.\n\n\n\nTYRUS: And he just took it, and, and there's a lot of people -- Shannon Sharpe, the best thing. because he said he'd still be whipping his ass right now if he tried that with him.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: But you know, what -- I still want to -- we got to move on, but I still want to know what was on the tip of Chris Rock's tongue when he says --\n\n\n\nMACCALLUM: Yes.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: I'm up --\n\n\n\nTYRUS: He was going to talk about this the singer in the house.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: I wasn't sure if it was that or something even, even more sensitive.\n\n\n\nTYRUS: Even more personal, yes.\n\n\n\nKUDLOW: Tyrus, on points -- I mean, if you were, you know, scoring the match, who would've won that?\n\n\n\nTYRUS: Well, I mean --\n\n\n\nKUDLOW: Just the fisticuffs, that's the only part.\n\n\n\nTYRUS: Oh no, I'm throwing the towel on both guys. One guy's hands behind his back and the other guy couldn't take him off his feet. I would, I would refund tickets and apologize.\n\n\n\nKUDLOW: Take the boxing commission.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: We got to go.\n\n\n\nTYRUS: He's done.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Up next, police funding gets the nod and a move that will upset the squad.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nJONATHAN HUNT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF CORRESPONDENT: This is a Fox News Alert. I'm Jonathan Hunt live in Lviv. Ukrainian forces claimed to have taken a Kyiv suburb and an eastern town from the Russians. A senior U.S. defense official says it's believed Ukraine's military recaptured trust units in the eastern part of the country. And the mayor of Irpin says the Kyiv suburb has been liberated from Russian troops.\n\n\n\nMeantime, according to British intelligence, Russia is deploying its private military firm to eastern Ukraine. The U.K. says the Wagner group is expected to send more than 1000 mercenaries including its senior leaders to undertake combat operations. And a cyber-attack against Ukraine's national telecommunications provider, knocking out telephone Internet and mobile services.\n\n\n\nStay with Fox News for all your coverage of the ongoing war on Ukraine. I'm Jonathan Hunt live in Lviv. Now back to \"GUTFELD.\"\n\n\n\nANNOUNCER: \"WHOOPS! BOY, DID WE --\"\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Well, wonders never cease, now the Dems want to refund the police. Yes, Biden wants to spend a zillion bucks after his policies turned cops just sitting ducks. The President's proposing more than $33 billion to fight crime nationwide as part of his 2023 budget.\n\n\n\nThe proposal includes 3.2 billion in discretionary resources for state and local grants, and 30 billion in mandatory resources to support local law enforcement, crime prevention, and community violence intervention. It also includes funding for more deputy marshals and ATF agents on major cities, with a special unit dedicated just to Kat Timpf.\n\n\n\nBut is this renewed focus on crime too little too late? Is it like when I brought condoms to a gender reveal? Or is it a political ploy Biden is using to clean up the mess Democrats have made with progressive policies like no cash bail and defund the police crusades. They're just like arsonists who bill you for the gasoline. And just in time for the midterms when Dems need to wash the stank of their pro crime agenda off their clothes. So, Joe, now you want to fund police? What gives?\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nTOM SHILLUE, COMEDIAN: Hey, look, look, don't give me that man. Look, this the process, you fund the police, then you defund the police, then you refund the police. Look, I'm in the refund. What goes around comes around. Come on, man. I've been in this business a long time. I know what I'm doing. My wife's a doctor. I rode the Amtrak, right? I mean, Kamala, she used to be a prosecutor, attorney district general. I've threatened court pop with a chain man. And so, I'm like McGruff, the crime dog. Remember that guy? What he used to say, only you can prevent forest fires.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: That made a lot of sense, Martha, is going to help them in the midterms?\n\n\n\nMACCALLUM: Yes, I don't think so. I don't think that you're going to make cities safer, unless you can -- I didn't hear anything in there about how you're going to bring in the U.S. Marshals and all these other people. Everybody left law enforcement because they knew that nobody had their back. It's a dangerous job, and they need support of that kind. There's no discussion about that in any of this bill.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Larry, why should -- to Martha's point, this money is not going to make it to the right people, is it?\n\n\n\nKUDLOW: Well, I mean, his definition of cops is probably different than the normal definition.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Yes.\n\n\n\nKUDLOW: He's talking about social workers and stuff like that. He underfunded the Department of Homeland Security. So, there's nothing going on with respect to protecting the border. And in general, no one's going to believe Biden about regime change.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Yes, there you go. You know, Kat --\n\n\n\nKUDLOW: That was a joke.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: I get it. I got it. It was about as good as the G.I. Jane Joe.\n\n\n\nTYRUS: Walk over and smack him now or --\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Kat, you know I think you agree with me that all the money should go to build more prisons. I actually feel that way.\n\n\n\nTIMPF: I just can't believe that it took so long for them to deny, like, no, everything's fine, everything's fine, everything's fine when a lot of people could walk outside and things are very much not fine. And I, not just in terms of, you know, like what they call lifestyle crimes, but actual violent crimes are being taken seriously. So, but again, Martha, I don't think it helps either, because there's so many problems right now in this country that this is just one of many.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: What do you say, Tyrus.\n\n\n\nTYRUS: He just thinks the American people are stupid. First of all, when's this money coming, if ever even gets there, but more importantly, it's not enough.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Yes.\n\n\n\nTYRUS: First of all, start with an apology. Start with I believe in stand behind our law enforcement, say that clear as day, but he can't. And doesn't matter if we, if we bring in 10 million more police officers and detectives, you still got the same prosecutors and the same policies who are letting them out as soon as they get arrested. So, it's not going to change anything. You'll just have more guys going in and out.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: And we got to move on. But even if they pledged to back the police the moment one problematic video comes out, the entire Democratic Party runs away from them and then you're back at square one where nobody cares about the cops, and you get the, the Ferguson Effect all over again. That is a downer, but we're going to have more fun later.\n\n\n\nComing up, commuters use scooters to get their kicks. While those in cars, they can't drive stick. Yes, I can't drive a stick, and I'm proud of it.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: We are back. When it comes to cars with a clutch, Americans are out of touch. While gas prices have abused commuters, they're stuck using scooters. As supply chain issues impact the auto industry and national gas prices continue to rise, so as the popularity of using e-scooters to get around without going bankrupt, all it will cost you is your dignity.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal owned by our parent company, Pampers, several electric scooter manufacturers report massive increases in sales and Web traffic since gas prices are shooting up like passengers on the subway. Scooter rental programs have also skyrocketed in places like New York where public transit is more unpleasant than shopping for laptops with Jeffrey Toobin.\n\n\n\nSpeaking of joysticks, those who are driving, don't want to pick a car with a stick. According to data from U.S. News and World Report, only one percent of cars sold in America have manual transmissions, and only about 18 percent of Americans even know how to drive one. So, I guess driving a stick shift is a dying art. Much like my clay sculptures of various drifters.\n\n\n\nOf course, only the surface is made of clay. I'm going to go to you, Kat, you haven't driven in decades. So, does this story make any sense to you?\n\n\n\nTIMPF: Like one decade. Yes, it does, I guess but I am not getting on a scooter.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: No.\n\n\n\nTIMPF: No, because these like have they not heard of weather?\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Yes, I know.\n\n\n\nTIMPF: Maybe if I lived in a habitable climate, I would maybe get on a scooter. But it's cold all the time.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: I love how fast you can go in those scooters. People have almost killed me, Martha. You know, when you're crossing the street. They're coming at you, but they're delivering your food to you --\n\n\n\nMACCALLUM: Isn't that they go to 60 miles an hour.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Yes.\n\n\n\nMACCALLUM: I was like, that cannot be a good idea. I mean, I have a little bit of a lead foot. But I --\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: I've noticed.\n\n\n\nMACCALLUM: 60 miles -- you want to go 60 miles an hour on one of those things, and that sounds kind of crazy.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: They are always coming up Sixth Avenue when I'm trying to cross the street. You know, Larry, did you -- I bet you learned on a stick.\n\n\n\nKUDLOW: People of a certain age know how to use a stick shift.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Not me.\n\n\n\nKUDLOW: And I even learned on a stick shift as I did, because that's the only real form of driving. So, you understand what you're doing. All this other stuff nowadays. You just pushing buttons like a computer, you're not actually driving a car. So, I want to see more stick shifts.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: What did you drive? What did you drive?\n\n\n\nKUDLOW: a Pontiac Grand Prix and then later on an old Porsche, and it was just fabulous. The trouble is, unlike the bench seat with the stick shift kind of gotten away for certain activities.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: I got -- I know exactly.\n\n\n\nTIMPF: I'm confused.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Don't -- you know best --\n\n\n\nMACCALLUM: In the Grand Prix, in the park.\n\n\n\nTYRUS: It's hard to stack and you put your Halliburton for the money, it gets in the way.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Tyrus, scooters or stick, you pick. A rhyme.\n\n\n\nTYRUS: Neither.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: OK.\n\n\n\nTYRUS: First of all, I grew -- I had to learn on the stick.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Yes.\n\n\n\nTYRUS: But my problem was my feet were so big with the clutch in that thing. So, that was always fun, but I figured out. But a stick is like a buggy whip now. It's just gone. Those days are over, unless you are really expert driver with silver hair, you're not messing with a stick because everything now is push button and drive in.\n\n\n\nScooters, how are you going to put a family of three on a scooter? Is there a baby seat for the scooter? No, this is for single drifters who choose not to work for a living and they just borrow those things and leave them everywhere. Wait until you have 47 miles outside of your corner of your apartment, Gutfeld.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: I got bikes. I got all those stupid bikes.\n\n\n\nTYRUS: So, yes, you can't go anywhere, you can't commute.\n\n\n\nKUDLOW: These crazy people riding scooters, electric scooters, whatever they are they got their own scooter lane but they don't observe any traffic lights and they basically want to kill pedestrians especially in front of Fox.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: I know. Exactly. I agree with you.\n\n\n\nTIMPF: That is, that is a take.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: It is a take. I agree. All right.\n\n\n\nKUDLOW: It's not good.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: It is not good. Although, I love my electric bike. I love it like I gave birth to it.\n\n\n\nKUDLOW: Regime change.\n\n\n\nTYRUS: That would hurt.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: It would hurt. It would be very scrapy.\n\n\n\nTYRUS: I would go see sex --\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Yes, I was yes -- that's so adorable though when it's young.\n\n\n\nTYRUS: Good.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: All right. Up next, would it be nifty to live to 150? We discussed debate and whatever.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nANNOUNCER: \"A STORY IN FIVE WORDS\"\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: We're short on time. So, here's the story in five words, want to live to be 150? So, this story comes out all the time, Larry, it's researchers say oh, wait. It's possible. Do you believe it? And is it a good idea?\n\n\n\nKUDLOW: Well, I'm well on my way.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: You're in middle age.\n\n\n\nKUDLOW: I'm halfway there.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Yes.\n\n\n\nKUDLOW: And never felt better. Living to 150? I have to really think about that, think that through. Because so many trends, especially cultural trends now, I can't stand what I'm looking at. And we do need some regime change. But I'm glad I'm happy.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: There you go. You know, Kat, we were told that the world was supposed to end. What if you outlive earth? What do you do? Where do you go?\n\n\n\nTIMPF: Well, I don't think if the world ends that you keep living?\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: What if you can? What if you have a secret compartment under your house, made up some kind of weird fabric that you made in the summer?\n\n\n\nTIMPF: As long as I had a bunch of apes, that'd be good. I don't, I don't want, I'd like to live to 150 but I'd actually like to live even longer. Because then after that, what else do you do?\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Well, you want your cat to live forever.\n\n\n\nTIMPF: Well, he will live forever.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Yes, that's disgusting --\n\n\n\nTIMPF: I will make sure of that.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: That's disgusting.\n\n\n\nTIMPF: He's trying to die, but nope.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: You're never going to let that, that cat die.\n\n\n\nTIMPF: I am an now giving him an asthma inhaler twice per day.\n\n\n\nTYRUS: I just realize who you are.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Who am I?\n\n\n\nTYRUS: You are that kid that no one could have a conversation with because you would what if them to death. It didn't matter if you're winning the argument like nope, well, what if this? And what if a dinosaur came in? What would you do? So, you're not so strong now? Like, that's who you were. I would have beat you up a lot.\n\n\n\nThe idea of living to 150, I have absolutely no interest of it. Have seen you somebody a 100? Have you seen somebody 100?\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Yes, yes.\n\n\n\nTYRUS: Not a good sight.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: No, it's not.\n\n\n\nTYRUS: 50 years later, you're going to be a pile of goop. Nothing left of you.\n\n\n\nTIMPF: That's why I'm going to --\n\n\n\nKUDLOW: End the capital gains tax, by the time 150. I'd really love that.\n\n\n\nTYRUS: You want no capital gains from soup at 150.\n\n\n\nMACCALLUM: It all depends on what kind of 150 you are, you know.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Exactly.\n\n\n\nMACCALLUM: I mean, if you've got your mental facilities, and you can, you know, walk and talk then great. Otherwise, all good.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: I'm totally for it if they just take my brain and put it in a vat, right and plug these little stimuli in there. So, I'm happy all the time. I don't need to go out and eat dinner. But if I can just be in a vat of fluid, that would be the best world. You know, think about it. That's kind of what you do. That's what you want to do.\n\n\n\nMACCALLUM: That's the Metaverse.\n\n\n\nTIMPF: Kind of already kind of how I live.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: Exactly. It is the -- no, you're --\n\n\n\nMACCALLUM: It's the Metaverse.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: It's the Metaverse, right?\n\n\n\nMACCALLUM: I don't want to; I don't want to live in the Metaverse.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: No, you won't.\n\n\n\nKUDLOW: Oh, good.\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: All right. We got to move on. That was a fun show. What a great way to start a Monday. We'll be right back.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nGUTFELD: We are out of time. Set your DVRs so you never miss an episode. Thanks to Martha MacCallum, Larry Kudlow, Timpf, Tyrus. \"FOX NEWS @ NIGHT\" with evil Shannon Bream is next.

            "content": "GOP gubernatorial nominee in Oregon Christine Drazan discussed how Portland and Oregon as a whole are facing decline and struggling to reign in violent crime on \"Hannity.\"\n\nCHRISTINE DRAZAN: You know, Oregonians are demanding better. They're demanding better from their leaders. What we're experiencing has been a decade of decline under progressive, extreme, single-party leadership in our state, and we are feeling it across the whole state, but especially in Portland, where they are less safe today than they have ever been before.\n\nWe're seeing mom-and-pop shops close up. We're seeing national chains exit our beautiful city. And instead, we are leaving our city to people who are abusing hard drugs, which are now legal in our state, who in fact, are forming encampments that are refusing to leave public spaces.

The painting is enclosed in glass and aside from minor damage to the frame, the artwork is \"unharmed,\" the National Gallery said in a statement.\n\n\"Human creativity and brilliance is on show in this gallery, yet our heritage is being destroyed by our Government’s failure to act on the climate and cost of living crisis,\" Just Stop Oil said in a statement not long after the footage went viral.\n\n\"What use is art when we face the collapse of civil society?\" the group continued. \"The art establishment, artists and the art-loving public need to step up into Civil Resistance if they want to live in a world where humans are around to appreciate art.\"\n\nSunflowers were the subject of two series of paintings by van Gogh, and pieces of art from the floral set sell for tens of millions of dollars.\n\nThis is not Just Stop Oil's first public assault on Van Gogh — the revered painter is a common target of climate activists' attention.\n\nIn June, a pair of activists with Just Stop Oil glued their hands to the frame of a at a London gallery to protest the government’s climate policies.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLouis McKechnie, 21, and Emily Brocklebank, 24, glued themselves to Van Gogh’s 1889 painting, \"Peach Trees in Blossom, which hangs at the Courtauld Gallery at Somerset House in London.\n\n\"A piece of art receives this protection and state concern. Whilst people’s in Ethiopia, Somalia, India, Pakistan, the USA, Australia (to name a few) who are suffering from climate change NOW get ignored and left,\" the group wrote. \"What’s more important?

            "content": "Ford makes some pretty cool pickups, and one of them may be about to get even cooler. Or hotter, depending on the time of year.\n\nThe automaker has received a patent for a novel system that provides climate control for a pickup bed, Muscle Cars & Trucks first reported.\n\nThe patent describes several ways to connect the cabin ventilation system to the bed of a unibody truck like the Maverick, although it doesn't mention the compact pickup by name.\n\nDucting in the front wall of the bed or the bed sides could provide cooled or heated air to the storage area through vents that could even be installed within a bed liner.\n\nThe system would presumably be used in concert with a bed cover, but could potentially work with a slide-in camper.\n\nThe Maverick is currently Ford's only unibody pickup, but the midsize Honda Ridgeline features a similar construction, so it's not out of the realm of possibility that Ford could add a larger unibody model down the road.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn fact, while Ford's first electric pickup, the F-150 Lighting, features a separate body and cab, some purpose-designed electric pickups like the GMC Hummer EV and Chevrolet Silverado EV have bodies integrated with their beds.\n\nBoth GM trucks are available with a Multi-Flex Midgate option that allows the bed wall to be folded down into the cabin. It's not the same as Ford's ventilation system, but can provide climate control to an enclosed bed.",

            "description": "Supreme Court climate ruling returned power to the people",
            "content": "The Supreme Court’s ruling in West Virginia v. the Environmental Protection Agency, holding that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) cannot remake the U.S. energy sector without authorization from Congress, returns power to the American people instead of a bloated bureaucracy in Washington, D.C. As an added benefit, it will also prevent radical increases in energy costs — a welcome relief given 40-year high inflation.\n\nThe case arose from one of President Barack Obama’s attempts to bypass Congress. In his first term, Obama tried to get Congress to pass a cap-and-trade law to reduce carbon emissions.\n\nObama candidly admitted that \"under my plan of a cap-and-trade system, electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket.\" Unsurprisingly, supersizing energy bills was unpopular with voters and their elected representatives. Thus, despite large Democratic majorities in both houses of Congress, the Senate never even voted on President Obama’s proposal. After the bill died, Obama ordered the bureaucracy to gin up new regulations to reduce carbon emissions on their own.\n\nIn 2015, the Obama Administration’s EPA followed through with their Clean Power Plan (CPP). The Clean Air Act says power plants must use the \"best system of emission reductions\" to hold down pollution. This provision has long been interpreted to require individual power plants to use the best (feasible) technology to prevent pollution. The CPP reinterpreted that provision to allow the EPA to set statewide limits on carbon emissions. These limits were virtually impossible for fossil fuel power plants to achieve. The CPP thus effectively capped carbon emissions from fossil fuel power plants and pushed states to subsidize alternative energy sources like wind or solar.\n\nThe CPP rule was a big deal. The Obama Administration estimated it was equivalent to taking more than two-thirds of U.S. passenger vehicles off the road. Cap-and-trade couldn’t get through Congress, but, with legal gymnastics, the EPA decided it could impose a version of cap-and-trade on its own. EPA wanted to fundamentally reshape the energy market while bypassing approval from voters’ elected representatives.\n\nUnfortunately, the federal government often operates this way. When I ran the Department of the Interior, I directed career attorneys to list all the department’s statutory duties specifically regarding climate change. There were only two: helping the Department of Energy with a report and writing another report on water issues. Nonetheless, leftist Members of Congress would often call on the Department to \"stop climate change!\" They wanted the Interior to transform America — without their doing the hard work of developing a consensus in Congress to pass a law. I would tell these Members of Congress to pass their law, and when they did, I would faithfully execute it. The Obama Administration’s EPA was not so restrained.\n\nDuring the Trump Administration, the EPA replaced the CPP with a plan based on the traditional understanding of the law. Last year, a liberal panel of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the Trump Administration’s rule and ruled that EPA could impose cap-and-trade type policies.\n\nThe Supreme Court just rejected those arguments.\n\nThe America First Policy Institute filed an amicus brief, arguing that the Court should apply the major questions doctrine, which holds that agencies cannot issue regulations that have a major national impact (such as the CPP) without clear statutory authority. The Court agreed, ruling \"it is not plausible that Congress gave EPA the authority to adopt on its own such a regulatory scheme … [a] decision of such magnitude and consequence rests with Congress itself, or an agency acting pursuant to a clear delegation from that representative body.\" In other words, creatively reinterpreting the law to discover sweeping grants of previously unknown authority doesn’t cut it.\n\nThis is great news for everyone who pays electricity bills, especially lower-income Americans, small businesses, and seniors on fixed incomes. The Biden Administration’s EPA is drafting a cap-and-trade type rule that goes even further than Obama’s. Under the Biden Administration’s rule, \"electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket.\" The Court’s ruling means the Biden Administration can only impose such regulations if Congress votes for them.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThe ruling is even better news for American democracy. The Supreme Court’s decision returns power to the people. It means that the people make the rules through their elected representatives — not federal bureaucrats. Agency officials do not stand for election. They have no democratic mandate to impose sweeping societal changes unilaterally. The Court’s application of the major questions doctrine protects individuals, businesses, and others from agencies that act without legal authority. That authority rests with the people’s elected representatives in Congress.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nUnsurprisingly, the American people agree. Recent polling by Scott Rasmussen shows that by a 42% to 31% margin, Americans trust voters and their elected representatives more than government agencies and policy experts to establish major regulations. A plurality of Americans also believes the EPA should need approval from Congress before issuing regulations limiting greenhouse gasses.\n\nThe Court’s decision returns governing authority to the American people. This ruling protects democracy — not to mention Americans coping with soaring energy bills.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY INTERIOR SECRETARY DAVID BERNHARDT",

They believe in this. They believe in high gasoline prices. They believe in making was very difficult. They would like you to live in a small apartment near a bus or on mass transit, not have a car, have a limited future, and rely on government to take care of you. I mean, that's their worldview, and they are fully prepared to punish the American people. You can't think of these people as normal, traditional politicians in the American tradition. These people are real ideologues, much closer to the Bolshevik tradition in Russia, and they are willing to do whatever it takes to force you to do what they want you to do.\n\nLISTEN TO THE FULL INTERVIEW BELOW:",

            "content": "Former Trump Senior Advisor Kellyanne Conway says all but a handful of Americans do not think climate should be a top priority as the President Biden considers taking executive action.\n\nKELLYANNE CONWAY: Well, what a wildly unpopular president who's every minute of nearly 80-years-old talks about transitioning. You know that that's not going to happen. So Sean this is what's fascinating. If the president actually takes executive action as he is threatening to do, people should know what that means. It means that he has subverted the process of our elected representatives who are put there by the people. And instead, an unpopular president is basically acting alone. And it comes with tons of money that he can repurpose for these climate reasons that the vast, vast majority of Americans I mean, all but a handful of Americans do not think should be a top priority. In addition to your point about foreign dictators and their oil. You've got a lot of the climate activists asking Joe Biden to go further than his de facto moratorium on offshore drilling right now. They want him to cancel existing leases and he basically wants us to have a self-imposed moratorium on oil and gas in this country while lifting the sanctions for Iran and Venezuela. People need to know this is scary stuff.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBy the way, Joe Biden needs to know something. You don't need to be a pollster to conclude the following. If a majority of Democrats and voters of color, and women and others don't want you to run for a second term, it's because they don't like what you're doing in the first term. And so taking an issue that's mired in single digits like the climate crisis and ignoring inflation is how he earns the 19% approval rating among Hispanics. They no more want to run out and buy electric cars than they want to call themselves Latin X. If you look at all of the polls. And I don't know, Sean, why Joe Biden even tries to be woke because there's no way you can be woke if you're sound asleep.",

            "description": "Local environmentalists in southeastern England expressed concern with Prince William's plans to move forward with a sustainable 2,500-home eco village.",
            "content": "Prince William is planning to move forward with his father King Charles III's plans to construct a sustainable \"garden city\" with 2,500 homes in southeastern England.\n\nThe plan to build the sustainable eco village stretching across 320 acres of farmland in Kent, England, was previously heralded by King Charles III when he was the duke of Cornwall, a title that transferred to Prince William when his father ascended the throne in September. The Duchy of Cornwall, now under Prince William's stewardship, is expected to submit a formal planning application next year.\n\nHowever, local environmentalists have repeatedly pushed back against the project, arguing that it would wreak havoc on the fragile ecosystem in the region. They said the project would threaten several species, including protected bats, lizards, butterflies and wild orchids.\n\n\"I've emailed and written to Prince William but I haven't had a reply,\" Faversham resident Mark Sewel said in an interview. \"He is a younger and more modern royal who may be more sympathetic to the environmental damage that will be caused if this development continues.\"\n\nBRITAIN'S NEW KING CHARLES IS A CLIMATE HAWK WHO HAS CALLED FOR ‘RADICALLY TRANSFORMING’ FOSSIL FUEL ECONOMY\n\n\"The farmland is so rich in biodiversity and this scheme will destroy habitats,\" Sewel continued. \"So many protected species will be lost – there are bats, lizards, butterflies and wild orchids. It's so sad.\"\n\n\"I have concerns about losing such good farmland. In the current climate, we need food self-security. Farmland should be kept in operation at all costs,\" he added.\n\nPHOTO OF KING CHARLES, PRINCE WILLIAM AND THEIR WIVES SHOWS 'STUNNING EXAMPLE OF FAMILY UNITY': EXPERT\n\nStill, officials involved in the project have defended it, saying the developer would ensure the local environment and biodiversity were protected during construction.\n\n\"During four years of design work and community consultation, we have created a plan underpinned by our key principles of working with the landscape and existing natural environment to build a sustainable community,\" the project's estates director Ben Murphy said.\n\n\"Our team is very excited to be presenting the plans to the local community, whose feedback at prior events has greatly helped shape what we will be presenting,\" he added.\n\nThe developer also pledged to ensure a net biodiversity gain of 20% by making new wildlife habitats and green spaces accessible. In November, public exhibitions of the project will be put on display for locals to view.\n\nThe project's construction could create as many as 2,500 new jobs.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn addition to 2,500 homes, plans for the eco village include a new primary school, cricket pitch, shops and business spaces. The town's infrastructure will use low-carbon materials, be less car dependent, rely on solar power and battery storage, ground source heat pumps and high levels of \"airtightness.\"\n\n\"Beautifully-designed public spaces and streets will be designed around the pedestrian rather than the car, and provide a sense of wellbeing and connection to nature, helping to create a new community that will thrive in the longest term, for people and the planet,\" a website for the project states.\n\nOverall, since taking over the Duchy of Cornwall last month, Prince William has become one of the U.K.'s largest landowners. His royal estate is valued at more than $1 billion.",

The group says its goal is to highlight the need for tougher action against global warming but the protests have sparked fierce criticism among some in Germany who say they're dangerous and harm the climate cause.\n\nGRETA THUNBERG REMOVED BY GERMAN POLICE FROM SITE OF MASS-CLIMATE CHANGE PROTEST AT COAL MINE\n\n\"At times the situation here was extremely close to tipping point,\" Onay told The Associated Press. \"There were some very confrontational situations with a lot of anger on the roads during such blockades.\"\n\n\"That's why I wanted to resolve this and not let it escalate further,\" he said.\n\nIn a letter to senior German lawmakers posted on his Instagram account, Onay said he supports the group's call for a general speed limit on national highways, a measure that experts say would considerably reduce greenhouse gas emissions from cars at little cost. He also backed a system of public transport fares that would be even cheaper than the 49 euro ($52) monthly ticket agreed last year.\n\nThe Hannover mayor said he disagrees with the group's demands for citizens' assemblies that would have the power to legislate national climate action, but that he supports creating such bodies to advise parliaments.\n\nIn a statement, Last Generation said it has agreed to stop its protests in Hannover in response to Onay's letter, the first city where such an agreement has been reached.\n\nOnay, a former Green party lawmaker who has led the city of more than 500,000 inhabitants since 2019, said further talks would depend on the activists sticking to their side of the bargain.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I made clear that we won't allow ourselves to be blackmailed and we won't accept an ultimatum,\" he told The AP. \"If we are to have a conversation then it can only be without protests.\"",

The fund is an international effort to preserve the rainforest, channeling donations to prevent, monitor and combat deforestation while promoting sustainability. Kerry and Silva discussed their plans, but said the U., Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, still needs to negotiate with Congress before it can earmark specific amounts for environmental funding. Kerry was scheduled to meet with Silva again on Tuesday, as well as Sônia Guajajara, the Indigenous Peoples Minister, who recently returned from the remote corner of the Amazon rainforest where two British journalists were murdered last year.",

            "description": "A group of Republican lawmakers on a key financial panel are probing the Department of the Treasury over a recent climate change regulation impacting insurance companies.",
            "content": "EXCLUSIVE: Republican lawmakers on a key House Financial Services Committee panel are probing the Biden administration's efforts to impose its climate agenda on insurance companies.\n\nIn a letter Friday to Federal Insurance Office (FIO) Director Steven Seitz, every Republican member of the House and Insurance Subcommittee, led by Chairman Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, expressed concern about the agency's recent actions to collect climate-related data from property and casualty insurers.\n\nThe lawmakers argued such actions were limited to state insurance regulators, not the FIO which is a subagency of the Treasury Department. The letter to Seitz also noted that while the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 authorizes the agency to collect certain data, it limits such actions to traditional regulation and mandates consultation with state insurance regulators.\n\n\"Climate alarmists and activists are abusing the Federal Insurance Office by overstepping state regulators to collect climate data,\" Davidson told Fox News Digital in a statement. \"The FIO’s lack of good faith to coordinate with state insurance regulators sets a dangerous precedent that could ultimately undermine Congress’s intent under the Dodd-Frank consumer protection law.\"\n\nBIDEN CONSIDERING TEARING DOWN KEY GREEN ENERGY SOURCE OVER ECO CONCERNS\n\nAccording to the Cornell Legal Information Institute, the Dodd-Frank Act established the FIO to monitor the U.S. insurance industry to identify issues or gaps that could result in crises. However, the statute specifically requires the office to \"consult with the states regarding insurance matters of national or international importance.\"\n\nDavidson and his fellow Republican subcommittee members wrote in their letter that the FIO's recent actions deviate from \"the letter and spirit of Dodd-Frank.\"\n\n\"Requiring FIO to coordinate with state insurance regulators is critical to ensuring that FIO can conduct relevant activities to achieve its goals while also maintaining the proven state-based regulation of insurance,\" they wrote. \"However, we believe that FIO has knowingly sidestepped this requirement to advance its own agenda.\"\n\nIn August 2021, the FIO released a request for information on a proposal to obtain climate-related financial risk data from the insurance sector. Then, in October, the FIO issued a proposed data collection, asking for public comments by the middle of December. The action would require 213 insurance companies to share data from every U.S. zip code.\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen said at the time that the action was \"an important step in determining how Americans are being affected by the increasing costs of climate change.\" She noted the devastation caused by Hurricane Ian in Florida as an example of why the agency needed to move forward with the action.\n\nHowever, while the action was lauded by left-wing groups like Center for American Progress and Public Citizen, it was blasted by both the insurance industry and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), a group representing state regulators.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"As the primary regulators of this sector, state insurance regulators are on the frontlines of natural catastrophe preparedness and response, protecting policyholders and maintaining well-functioning insurance markets,\" NAIC officials wrote to the Treasury Department in November. \"State insurance regulators, through the NAIC, have had a climate-specific working group for more than a decade.\"\n\n\"It is unclear how FIO will use the data they intend to collect, and it is likely that any analysis will be misinterpreted and produce fallacious results in trying to identify climate risk,\" they continued. \"Treasury is requesting property insurance market data at a granular level, but it is unclear how that data will be married with other information to illustrate climate risk specifically.\"\n\nIn addition to Davidson, Reps. Bill Posey, R-Fla., Blaine Luetkemeyer, R-Mo., Ralph Norman, R-S.C., Scott Fitzgerald, R-Wisc., Andrew Garbarino, R-N.Y., Mike Flood, R-Neb., Michael Lawler, R-N.Y., Monica De La Cruz, R-Texas, and Erin Houchin, R-Ind., signed the letter to Seitz.\n\nThe FIO didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",

The lawmakers argued that such actions were limited to state insurance regulators, not the Treasury Department, and that while the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 authorizes the agency to collect certain data, it limits such actions to traditional regulation and mandates consultation with state Insurance regulators. The Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said at the time that the action was \"an important step in determining how Americans are being affected by the increasing costs of climate change.\" However, while the action is lauded by left-wing groups like Center for American Progress and Public Citizen, it was blasted by both the insurance industry and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC).",

            "content": "Laura Ingraham said Democrats want to change the rules for election policies to ensure future wins Monday on \"The Ingraham Angle.\"\n\nLAURA INGRAHAM: Crooked democracy crusaders — that's the focus of tonight's Angle. Oh, the globalists are so mad. The same people who claim to be the great defenders of democracy pan elections when they don't like the outcomes. Such was the case after French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen won a runoff spot yesterday against elite favorite Emmanuel Macron.\n\nNow, whatever you think about Le Pen and her ideas, what the MSNBC crew can't fathom is that millions of unhappy voters in France are saying no to the status quo. They don't believe that Macron or the other mainstream parties can make things better for French workers. We've seen similar dynamics in recent elections in Hungary and in Poland and in Britain, of course, during the debate over Brexit. The media never figures this out. They just complain, as always, that democracy is on the line in France. It's not Macron's fault for being a bad politician. It's the voters' fault for questioning the elites. They even claim that France is facing an attack on its democracy. Now this is just ridiculous hogwash. But it's what they did when Trump won in 2016. Remember?\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nNow these are all lies. Yet they're not going to stop. In anticipation of a November route here, they're desperate to change election rules. Well, I fully expect a COVID variant mail-in ballot push. Oh yes. Now, in fact, in March of 2021, Biden, remember, issued an executive order on supposed voting access that few Republicans seem prepared for. It's a backdoor way to federalize the state-run voter registration and ballot process. Now, a claim that in our country — which, remember, elected Barack Obama twice, minorities, they say, still face significant barriers to voting, specifically claiming that these voters remain more likely to face long lines at the polls and are disproportionately burdened by other identification laws and limited opportunities to vote by mail, and then directing that federal agencies and this executive order consider ways to expand voter registration, including through vote-by-mail application forms, use of online systems and helping applicants complete their voter registration forms.",

            "description": "How COVID data will change after Biden's testing push  Fox News",
            "content": "Amid a surge of the omicron variant of the coronavirus, the Biden administration launched a new testing initiative last week, sending every residence four free rapid tests and requiring private health insurers to cover up to eight at-home tests per month for those on their plans.\n\nThe White House had faced criticism over their pandemic response efforts for the last couple of months – especially as states shattered cases records, Americans found rapid tests extremely scarce or overpriced, and wait times for PCR tests were hours long in frigid temperatures.\n\nWhile increased access to affordable at-home testing is imperative to halt the spread of the virus, questions regarding how this new push will shape the nation's understanding of pandemic data remain.\n\nLeaders in several states say the omicron wave is seemingly slowing – although scientists predict it will not be the last variant of concern threatening the U.S.\n\nMassachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, for example, said last Tuesday that the state appears to be on the \"back side\" of omicron.\n\nHe told reporters during a news conference that it is observing COVID-19 levels in wastewater heading on \"exactly the same trajectory\" that other parts of the country, the U.K. and South Africa have seen.\n\nCOVID-19: NEARLY HALF OF VIRUS HOSPITALIZATIONS IN MASSACHUSETTS ARE FOR OTHER ISSUES\n\nDr. Ali Raja, executive vice chair of the Department of Emergency Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, was recently swabbing a patient. He pointed out that Boston's wastewater had shown that the prevalence of COVID was much greater than was being reported by the state because \"a lot of people were likely testing at home and just not telling anybody that they came back positive.\"\n\n\"But, there was no way to report that,\" Raja told Fox News. \"And so, there [are] a lot of positive tests that are being done at home that aren't reported. And contact tracing with a system that doesn't allow for reporting with rapid tests that don't have any software linkages is bound to result in underreporting and make contact tracing impossible.\"\n\nHe said that in order to develop a contact tracing program that's effective, there need to be ways for at-home tests to be reported positive – and easy methods for patients who are older.\n\n\"There has to be an easier way to do that. And, that's just not something that's available right now,\" Raja added.\n\nNational COVID-19 data provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows the U.S. has recorded more than 70.6 million cases of the disease and more than 864,000 deaths. Data from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center shows more than 868,000 deaths, with more than 71 million cases.\n\nThe true toll of the pandemic is much greater and records of excess mortality show many more people have died in America and around the world.\n\nWhile countries have reported more than 5.6 million deaths in two years, global excess deaths are estimated at two to four times greater, according to Nature.\n\n\"I think as long as we understand that the data is under and likely not overreported, we can rely on the trends. Because [those] reasons for underreporting – especially in terms of home testing – they haven't changed considerably,\" Raja said. \"And so, while I think that the overall numbers are lower than the actual prevalence of COVID is right now, the trends are what we can rely on.\"\n\nWhile the future of testing and pandemic America remains uncertain, best practices for testing are not.\n\n\"When you have symptoms, rapid tests can be falsely negative. And so, it's really still important – just like we've told people for years – to stay home from work if you're feeling sick,\" he said, adding that at-home rapid tests can be good for these types of decision-making situations, as long as an individual has no symptoms.\n\nStill, he worries a lot about falsely negative tests, especially for those who present symptoms.\n\nFor his patients, Raja recommends testing before coming out of isolation – something the CDC didn't initially recommend – and said to come out of isolation without a negative test \"still seems risky.\"\n\nHe also urged people to address price gouging and testing inequities that impact underserved communities the most.\n\n\"I think we're starting to see some change and that is all about the simple changes of masking and testing,\" Raja said. Because we know that there'll be the next variant … And, the fact that now we're starting to get to a place where we can widely distribute tests and that we're recommending high-quality masks, we can actually hopefully decrease the spikes, even if the variants are more transmissible like omicron or potentially less transmissible.\"\n\nHe said that while he is hopeful this round of test distribution will be a start to the help health care systems and hospitals like Massachusetts General need, four tests are not going to be enough for workers and their families.\n\n\"We need to have a much more sustainable system than just mailing out for tests,\" Raja said.\n\nRecently, some state health authorities instructed medical professionals and health care workers that they can continue to work after testing positive if they have no symptoms or just mild ones.\n\nCOVID-19: NEARLY HALF OF VIRUS HOSPITALIZATIONS IN MASSACHUSETTS ARE FOR OTHER ISSUES\n\nRaja said this is a \"tough decision,\" but that the places doing this well are following current CDC guidance.\n\nMany hospitals are severely shorthanded, but infection with COVID-19 is not the only reason.\n\n\"For the health care workers that really focus on saving everybody's lives when they come into the hospital, the two biggest challenges right now are our staffing and burnout,\" he said, highlighting that those who are coming to work find themselves with double the amount of work.\n\n\"There are so many nurses, physician assistants and nurse practitioners and doctors and environmental services personnel and administrative people I've spoken to who have talked about the fact that they are just done with health care and their jobs,\" he added. \"And once they leave, finding the people to fill their roles – it's becoming harder and harder.\"\n\n\"I get that there [are] so many important industries that are impacted, but this is a real challenge for us because there is going to be a need for health care workers after COVID,\" Raja concluded.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "content": "U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday said the U.S. wasn’t seeking \"regime change\" in Moscow.\n\n\"In any event, it’s not up to us,\" he told the BBC from Brussels. \"The Russian people need to decide their leadership. They need to decide whether the leaders that are there are actually advancing and representing their needs, their interests, their will. It’s absolutely not up to us.\"\n\nBlinken said he would ask the Russian people, if he could, how the \"war of aggression, unprovoked, unwarranted on Ukraine\" is helping them in their everyday lives.\n\n\"How is it sending a kid to school? How is it getting you a job? How is it cleaning the air? How is it dealing with the things you care about?\" he questioned.\n\nBLINKEN SAYS ‘NO STRATEGIC INTEREST’ IN RUSSIA ENERGY SANCTIONS, RESISTS CALLS FOR OIL IMPORT BAN\n\nOn the contrary, he told the BBC, the Russian people are \"tragically\" bearing the burden of President Vladimir Putin’s war because of the massive sanctions imposed on the country by the U.S. and its allies.\n\nThe secretary also praised the \"resilience\" of the Ukrainian people, saying, \"If it's the intention of Moscow to try somehow to topple the government and install its own puppet regime, 45 million Ukrainians are going to reject that one way or the other.\"\n\nBlinken arrived in Brussels on Friday for meetings with NATO allies. He will be in Europe for a week, traveling next to Poland, Moldova, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.\n\nHis dismissal of regime change came a day after U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., was heavily criticized for suggesting someone in Russia should assassinate Putin. Blinken didn’t mention Graham's tweet in his comments.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe White House refuted Graham’s remarks as well.\n\n\"That is not the position of the United States government and certainly not a statement you’d hear come from the mouth of anybody working in this administration,\" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Friday.\n\nOn Friday, Graham backtracked slightly, calling for Putin’s arrest and saying the Russian leader should be declared a war criminal.",

We are pausing gender affirmation surgeries on patients under age 18 while we complete this review, which may take several months.\"\n\nThe statement comes in relation to calls from Tennessee lawmakers to investigate the clinic following a report from conservative activist Matt Walsh.\n\nPARENT GROUPS REACT TO BIDEN ADMIN'S UPCOMING TITLE IX CHANGES: ‘BLURRING AND IN EFFECT ERASING WOMEN’\n\nRepublican Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, R-Tenn., and others called for an investigation after the September report, which claimed that VUMC \"drugs, chemically castrates and performs double mastectomies on minors.\"\n\nThe VUMC denied any wrongdoing in a statement to Fox News Digital at the time, saying that it conducts all of its care \"in compliance with state law and in line with professional practice standards.\"\n\nVanderbilt University denied involvement in the VUMC in a statement to Fox News.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nA series of videos from Vanderbilt staff came to light in September, showing the medical center's discussions surrounding the practices, which have been offered for both children and adults.\n\nAssistant professor Dr. Shayne Taylor can be heard in a 2018 video apparently discussing \"top surgery.\"\n\n\"Some of our VUMC financial folks in October of 2016 put down some costs of how much money we think each patient would bring in. And this is only including top surgery, this isn't including any bottom surgery, and it's a lot of money,\" Taylor said in the video.",

            "description": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's constituents weighed in on how the Inflation Reduction Act kept the carried interest loophole, but addressed climate change.",
            "content": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's constituents weighed in on how Democrats removed a prosed tax hike affecting billionaires from the Inflation Reduction Act in order to pass the massive spending bill and its climate initiatives.\n\n\"The billionaires are the people with the power to really change whatever it is that we're trying to change,\" one man, Daniel, told Fox News. \"We shouldn't vote for it if that’s something that’s not being addressed.\"\n\nBut another man, Paul, said: \"Passing a bill for environment—anything that would help climate change, I'm for it. If the rich get a break, big deal.\"\n\nThe Senate on Sunday passed the Democrats' Inflation Reduction Act, a $433 billion spending bill which included $369 billion in spending for climate initiatives while imposing a 15% minimum tax on corporations with more than $1 billion in annual profits. The legislation at one point included language that would have effectively raised taxes for the richest in the country by changing rules for carried interest, but was removed to secure Sen. Kyrsten Sinema's vote.\n\nAS INFLATION REDUCTION ACT MOVES THROUGH CONGRESS, AMERICANS WEIGH IN ON IMPORTANCE OF CLIMATE INITIATIVES\n\n\"The whole bill is a mess,\" one man, Tom, told Fox News. \"It’s a feel-good bill so the Democrats can say they did something and maybe they won't do so badly in the upcoming elections.\"\n\n\"There are things in the tax code that allow people to write off various things, so, what are you what are you going to do?\" he said.\n\nDaniel said Democrats should vote against the bill until the carried interest provision is added back in. As it stands, carried interest – a share of an investment fund's profits paid to executives – has a lower tax rate than other workers may see.\n\n\"If they're not going to pay their share … I think that's definitely something that needs to be tweaked in the bill,\" Daniel told Fox News.\n\nAnother man, Zion, was skeptical about how much the bill could actually accomplish.\n\nDEMOCRATS' 2024 DECISION COULD BE SWAYED BY MAJOR SPENDING BILL WIN\n\n\"I don't really trust anything that the government has going on when it comes to the climate or when it comes to really anything,\" Zion told Fox News. He added that politicians already \"failed humanity\" with their inaction on climate change over the past two decades.\n\nSens. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, both liberals with a history of knocking financial \"loopholes\" voted for the Inflation Reduction Act. Ocasio-Cortez, known for her aggressive stance toward increasing taxes on billionaires, is set to vote on the bill Friday.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Climate change is something that's gone ignored for far too long,\" Max told Fox News. \"If there are places where you have to compromise in order to get change done efficiently and quickly, I think it's just something that we have to take on right now.\"\n\nZion said he's lost faith in the government’s ability to help the average American.\n\n\"It's always going to be for the betterment and the protection of people who are at a higher social and economic status than people like myself and people that reside in this area,\" he said.",

            "description": "A CNN online article about climate change recommended ways pet owners could minimize the significant impact their animals have on the environment.",
            "content": "A CNN climate piece arguing that pets and their \"meat-heavy diet\" are major contributors to climate change was shared online this week.\n\nThe piece offered ways that owners can reduce their beloved animals’ \"carbon pawprint.\"\n\nIt suggested pet owners re-assess their pet’s diet, offering \"lab-grown meat\" and \"insect-based pet foods\" as a potential option for them. The article also recommended making sure that pet products, such as leashes, bags, toys and bowls are recyclable, and also advised that potential owners maybe adopt smaller breeds to minimize climate impact.\n\nLONDON MAYOR SADIQ KHAN SLAMMED FOR 7,000 MILE FLIGHT TO CLIMATE CHANGE SUMMIT: 'HASN'T HE HEARD OF ZOOM?'\n\nThough the piece was written last month, the outlet shared the piece on Twitter Friday, causing a stir among users.\n\nThe piece opened with the statement, \"Our four-legged friends don’t drive gas-guzzling SUVs or use energy-sucking appliances, but that doesn’t mean they don’t have a climate impact. In fact, researchers have showed that pets play a significant role in the climate crisis.\"\n\nCNN pointed to the \"products we buy for them\" that contribute to the climate crisis, specifically their food. The article stated, \"Their meat-heavy diet is the biggest contributor to their carbon pawprints, which requires an abundance of energy, land and water to produce. And the production of pet food emits huge amounts of planet-warming gases.\"\n\nCiting a 2017 study, the outlet noted, \"feeding dogs and cats creates the equivalent of around 64 million tons of carbon dioxide in the US each year. That’s roughly the same impact as 13.6 million cars on the road.\"\n\nIt added that \"if our furry friends formed a separate country, it would rank 5th in global meat consumption behind China, the US, Brazil and Russia, according to UCLA professor and author of that study Gregory Okin.\"\n\nThough \"Bidding farewell to your best friends is not the answer,\" CNN said. Owners just need to \"minimize\" their pets’ \"environmental impact.\"\n\nOne recommendation was to alter pets’ diets. The piece described \"some new food developments on the market that are worth looking into, especially for dogs, including lab-grown meat.\"\n\nIn addition to that, there are \"insect-based pet foods\" which are \"nutritionally complete and are starting to come onto the market around the world.\"\n\nAnother recommendation offered was making sure necessary items, including, \"toys, bowls, litter, poop bags and leashes,\" can be recycled and are as environmentally friendly as possible. It also advised not buying wasteful accessories for pets, like costumes.\n\nLastly, the article recommended potential owners to adopt smaller pets for a smaller carbon footprint. \"The general rule is that larger pets will have a larger climate impact than smaller ones, primarily because they need more food. So you might consider smaller breeds or species if you’re aiming to minimize your impact on the planet.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",

            "description": "Washington Post journalist Taylor Lorenz was ridiculed on Twitter for sending sensational tweets blaming climate change and wealth inequality for teen depression.",
            "content": "Outspoken liberal reporter Taylor Lorenz raised eyebrows after she sent frantic tweets blaming climate change and wealth inequality for rising rates of teen depression.\n\nThe Washington Post columnist, who writes on social media misinformation, was outraged by the idea that teens' social media activity could be contributing to their anxiety and emotional distress.\n\n\"People are like ‘Why are kids so depressed? It must be their PHONES!’ But never mention the fact that we’re living in a late stage capitalist hellscape during an ongoing deadly pandemic w[ith] record wealth inequality, 0 social safety net/job security, as climate change cooks the world,\" Lorenz complained.\n\nThe tech columnist sent another heavy-handed tweet that read, \"Not to be a doomer, but u have to be delusional to look at life in our country rn [right now] and have any amt [amount] of hope or optimism.\"\n\nHer hyperbolic tweets drew strong reaction online, with conservatives suggesting the journalist take a break from Twitter.\n\n\"Taylor Lorenz looking up from her phone to tell us that it isn't phones that are bad and making her a Doomer - it's the reality the phones show us that's bad,\" podcast host Noam Blum noted.\n\n\"Ironically, this is the exact rhetoric of a person who spends entirely too much time on the phone. Maybe go for a walk. Get some sun,\" Columnist and program director for the National Journalism Center T. Becket Adams proposed.\n\nTAYLOR LORENZ SLAMMED FOR HYPOCRISY, ‘JEALOUSY’ AFTER ATTACKING FORMER NEW YORK TIMES COLLEAGUE BARI WEISS\n\nOthers wondered what experience Lorenz was speaking from, considering she was raised in an affluent family.\n\n\"We live in the most comfortable time in human history in the most powerful country in the world. And Taylor was born into the upper tier of that luxury. Maybe there’s something to be said for being *too* comfortable,\" columnist Bethany S. Mandel wrote.\n\n\"Former generations worked 80 hours, amassing wealth for their families, so that we could all complain on social media,\" author Daniel Buck teased in a reply to Mandel.\n\nOthers mocked the columnist's outrage with \"Someone didn't get their avocado toast that morning,\" and \"Looks like Taylor's midlife crisis is a rough one.\"\n\nAndrew Egger, editor at The Dispatch was puzzled by Lorenz's anxious posts, calling them \"bizarre\" and \"bewildering.\"\n\n\"This sort of thing is so bewildering to me. Lots of people have led happy, contented lives throughout history, and many of them weren't even among the more fortunate members of the richest and most comfortable society that has ever existed!\" he tweeted.\n\nIn other follow-up tweets, he suggested the journalist find a way to enjoy life and get off her phone.\n\nTAYLOR LORENZ SUSPENDED FROM TWITTER, CLAIMS ELON MUSK PERSONALLY REMOVED HER FROM PLATFORM\n\n\"Touch grass! Hold a baby! Do something nice for somebody you know! Go for a run! Accept Jesus Christ as your personal savior! Do anything other than continue to scroll!\" he advised.\n\nRetired journalist Richard Belcher had the same reaction, suggesting Lorenz read a book or visit a less fortunate country.\n\n\"Hmmm, ‘capitalist hellscape’ with 'record wealth inequality!' She should read some Charles Dickens — just for starters. Our just visit rural Peru or Sudan,\" he tweeted.\n\nOthers expressed concern over the tweets. Podcast host Tim Pool claimed the columnist needed intervention. \"I think she needs someone who cares about her to take her phone away and bring her to some type of rehabilitation,\" he wrote.\n\nLast year, Lorenz attacked Washington Post colleague Helaine Olen's \"absurd and insensitive post\" after Olen called it unhealthy for people to be trapped inside their houses due to fear over the coronavirus.\n\nLorenz also drew controversy in 2022 after she doxxed the previously anonymous creator of the LibsofTikTok Twitter account in a Washington Post article.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",

Others also expressed concern over the tweets, suggesting she read a book or visit a less fortunate country. Last year, Lorenz attacked Washington Post for publishing an article claiming that it was \"absurd and insensitive\" after a colleague accidentally tweeted a picture of a woman being trapped inside their houses after she accidentally removed the account of the creator of the LibsofTikik.",

            "content": "The Maine Climate Council created by Gov. Janet Mills is considering a proposal to pay a stipend to \"disadvantaged\" and \"overburdened\" Maine residents to attend meetings to ensure \"procedural equity\" in the government planning process to address climate change.\n\nThe council’s Equity Subcommittee, which was created last year as part of the state’s four-year climate action plan, has submitted its 2022 report, which states that \"all state policy, program and other decision-making processes should enable equitable participation from disadvantaged and historically underserved communities.\"\n\nIn order to ensure equitable participation, the subcommittee recommends providing \"stipends to frontline and disadvantaged community members for their time, which can help members of these communities take time off work or away from other critical activities to participate in decision-making processes,\" as well as \"providing transportation and child care in order to allow overburdened Maine people to attend meetings and participate in climate decision processes.\"\n\nThe climate council’s Energy Working Group met to discuss the subcommittee’s recommendations on Thursday, in which members argued the measures could break down barriers for low-income families to participate in government decisions surrounding environmental justice.\n\n\"Each strategy here is designed to address barriers, including, for example, providing transportation and child care,\" Jason Parent, the CEO of Aroostook County Action Program and a member of the Equity Subcommittee, said during the meeting. \"That’s a consideration that customers that our agency works with every day [say] often become an impediment and a barrier.\"\n\nSteve Clemmer, a research director at the Union of Concerned Scientists and a member of the climate council’s Industrial Innovation Task Force, cited a law signed by Mills last year that he said prioritizes \"intervenor compensation\" for community groups and disadvantaged communities to attend Public Utility Commission (PUC) meetings. He argued that the same should apply to climate planning.\n\n\"It has worked in the past,\" Clemmer said during the meeting. \"I think it’s a good model that would encourage some additional participation where there’s been very little to none at this point, at least in the PUC realm.\"\n\nIntervenor compensation programs exist in only a handful of states, including Maine, and provide financial reimbursement for residents to participate in state utility regulatory proceedings. Maine’s program is virtually inactive, according to Harry Lanphear, administrative director of the Maine Public Utilities Commission, who said in a 2021 report by the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) that there have been no requests for reimbursement \"in at least the last 10 years.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nClemmer said during Thursday’s meeting that \"rate payers\" theoretically foot the bill for the current program, but \"I don't know\" who would pay for it across other agencies like the climate council.\n\nThe governor's office of Policy Innovation and the Future, which oversees the Maine Climate Council, did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.",

            "description": "Associated Press gleeful over Democrats' climate bill: 'We're back baby'",
            "content": "AP News celebrated the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in the Senate in an article on Wednesday, claiming that the bill could rejuvenate the \"country’s reputation\" as an \"international leader on climate change.\"\n\nThe story, written by reporters Christina Lawson and Chris Megerian, focused on the Democratic Party’s elation for getting support for the bill and its major climate provisions, which seemed dead in the water a month ago.\n\nThe article claimed, \"Advocates feared that last month’s breakdown in negotiations in Congress had undermined efforts to limit the catastrophic effects of global warming. Now they’re energized by the opportunity to tout an unprecedented U.S. success.\"\n\nJennifer Turner, director of Woodrow Wilson Center’s China Environment Forum in Washington, told the Associated Press reporters, \"This says, ‘We’re back, baby.\"\n\nBIDEN SKEWERED FOR ADMITTING ‘GOD KNOWS WHAT ELSE’ IS IN INFLATION REDUCTION ACT\n\nAP News described the bill, writing, \"The legislation, which also has provisions on taxes and prescription drugs, includes about $375 billion over the next decade for clean energy development and financial incentives for buying electric cars, installing solar panels and weaning the power grid off fossil fuels.\"\n\nIt then touted the legislation as \"the single biggest investment in climate change in U.S. history, and a significant shift from years of inaction that limited Washington’s clout overseas.\"\n\nThough numerous economists have claimed that the $739 billion legislation will exacerbate current economic problems in the U.S., like adding to inflation.\n\nIn a letter reported on by Fox Business, these 230 economists asserted that the \"inaptly named ‘Inflation Reduction Act of 2022’ would do nothing of the sort and instead would perpetuate the same fiscal policy errors that have helped precipitate the current troubling economic climate.\"\n\nThe piece mentioned admonishing the U.S.’s previous climate inaction, citing the perspective of \"Poor nations\" that \"remain concerned that rich countries like the United States have not fulfilled financial commitments to help them cope with global warming and transition to clean energy, something the legislation does not address.\"\n\nThough AP noted that \"Biden can still point to it [the legislation] as evidence that the U.S. political system can address the world’s most pressing problems.\"\n\nComparing Trump’s inaction on climate change to Biden’s vows to fight it, the report stated, \"After President Donald Trump withdrew from the Paris climate accord, Biden entered office pledging to rejoin the fight against global warming. He set an ambitious new target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions — at least 50% below 2005 levels by 2030 — and began proposing policies to put the country on track.\"\n\nAs AP noted, Biden’s climate agenda has ambitious goals. \"The legislation that Biden is expected to sign is estimated to reduce emissions between 31% to 44%, according to an analysis by the Rhodium Group, an independent research firm,\" the piece stated.\n\nIt also cited Mohamed Adow, the director of foreign energy think tank Power Shift Africa, who bashed the previous administration. \"It’s good that finally the U.S. is trying to catch up after years of dragging its feet on climate change and this investment will go a long way to undoing some of the harm caused by the administration of President Trump,\" he said.\n\nThe piece looked to other experts to give the new U.S. climate agenda an attaboy. It quoted University of Pennsylvania director of China Programs and Strategic Initiatives, Scott Moore, who claimed, \"This restores some diplomatic legitimacy to the U.S. as an influential player in international climate negotiations.\"\n\nAP also provided a brief warning that losing Congress to the GOP in the midterms could pose a setback to the agenda. \"There will be no shortage of other challenges, too. If Republicans retake Congress or the White House, they could unravel Biden’s progress.\"\n\nOverall, AP News noted that climate activists see this as \"just one step on a larger path towards climate action,\" adding, \"More progress is needed to put the world on track to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), a target that some scientists believe is slipping out of reach.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",

            "content": "Actress Jane Fonda, 85, blamed the \"climate crisis\" on racism during an interview on \"The Kelly Clarkson Show.\"\n\nFonda appeared with her \"80 for Brady\" co-stars Lily Tomlin, Rita Moreno and Sally Field on the talk show this week to promote their new movie and reflect on what motivated them to get involved in social activism.\n\n\"For me, it was learning about the Vietnam War,\" Fonda said. \"And when I really understood what that was about, I couldn't not do anything except try to join the movement to stop it.\"\n\nJANE FONDA SAYS CANCER IS IN REMISSION: ‘BEST BIRTHDAY PRESENT EVER!’\n\nFonda was given the infamous nickname \"Hanoi Jane\" after posing atop an anti-aircraft gun during her 1972 visit to North Vietnam.\n\nClarkson asked Fonda how she branched out to other areas of activism, to which the actress suggested it wasn't much of a stretch.\n\n\"Well, you know, you can take anything - sexism, racism, misogyny, homophobia, whatever, the war,\" the actress said. \"And if you really get into it, and study it and learn about it and the history of it and everything's connected. There'd be no climate crisis if it wasn't for racism.\"\n\nMoreno asked Fonda for an explanation, to which she replied, \"Where would they put the s---?\"\n\n\"Where would they put the poison and the pollution?\" Fonda continued. \"They're not gonna put it in Bel Air. They've got to find some place where poor people or indigenous people or people of color are living. Put it there. They can't fight back. And that's why a big part of the climate movement now has to do with climate justice.\"\n\nFonda's climate activism made headlines in October 2019 when she was one of 16 people arrested on the Capitol steps at a Washington, D.C., climate change rally. The actress was charged with \"crowding, obstructing or incommoding.\"\n\nJANE FONDA SAYS HER ‘KNEES GAVE WAY’ WHEN SHE MET ‘GORGEOUS’ TOM BRADY: ‘I HAD TO HOLD ONTO SOMETHING’\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFonda had previously told the Los Angeles Times she planned to spend about four months in Washington for a series of sit-ins and rallies after getting approval from to take time off from her series \"Grace and Frankie,\" on which she stars with Tomlin. Fonda said she was inspired to rally by Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg.\n\nFonda has since been arrested multiple times for her climate protests.",

            "description": "The three Democrats — Reps. Barbara Lee, Katie Porter and Adam Schiff — running for an open Senate seat in California have backed far-left climate measures cheered by eco groups.",
            "content": "The three House Democrats who have announced they are running for Senate in California are proponents of far-left actions to combat climate change and have endorsed the multi-trillion-dollar Green New Deal.\n\nThe Democrats — Reps. Barbara Lee, Katie Porter and Adam Schiff — have supported aggressive policies to transition the U.S. grid from traditional fossil fuel sources to green energy like wind and solar power, argued for massive spending packages that would rapidly achieve such a transition and backed so-called environmental justice measures. The three have all recently entered the race to replace retiring Sen. Dianne Feinstein and are currently the highest-profile candidates.\n\nAccording to the League of Conservation Voters, a left-wing Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group that tracks how lawmakers vote on environmental and climate issues, Schiff has a 98% lifetime score while Lee and Porter boast 97% lifetime scores. The high scores indicate the three have a long track record of supporting measures backed by the far-left organization.\n\n\"From the devastating wildfires in my home state of California to the snowstorms in my birthplace of Texas, there’s no denying that the climate crisis is here, and the threat to the safety and economic security of our communities is growing by the day,\" Lee said after cosponsoring the Green New Deal alongside Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., in April 2021.\n\n\"In order to ensure a healthy and safe future for our children and grandchildren, the federal government must invest in bold policies that address the climate emergency head on, especially in communities of color and low-income communities that have experienced generations of environmental injustice,\" she added. \"Our solutions must match the scale of the crisis—that’s why I’m proud to support the Green New Deal.\"\n\nLee's congressional website further states that fighting climate change is a top priority for her, noting that she has fought oil companies and is working to ensure \"good-paying jobs created by the growing green energy sector are open to all, especially people of color, women and veterans.\"\n\nLee also joined a congressional delegation to a United Nations climate conference in Egypt late last year where she reaffirmed her commitment to giving billions of taxpayer dollars to the international \"Green Climate Fund\" and warned the \"window is closing fast\" on saving the planet.\n\nPorter has also been a vocal proponent of far-left climate proposals and signed on to the Green New Deal after she worked to strengthen \"pro-worker provisions\" in the legislation.\n\n\"Congresswoman Porter has fought to hold fossil fuel companies accountable for cleaning up after they drill, in addition to advocating for a future powered by clean energy,\" Porter's website states. \"Congresswoman Porter is taking action to accelerate our transition to clean energy and make the United States a leading green economy.\"\n\n\"She is a proud member of the Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition, which advocates for policies that promote renewable energy, address climate change, and create good green jobs.\"\n\nPorter has also repeatedly attacked the fossil fuel industry for its supposed \"misinformation campaigns.\" In August, she introduced legislation that would remove taxpayer-funded subsidies from oil companies that were used to help the industry market products, saying \"it’s bad enough these corporations poison the planet.\"\n\nENTIRE ALASKA DELEGATION MEETS WITH BIDEN AT WHITE HOUSE, IMPLORING APPROVAL OF MASSIVE OIL PROJECT\n\nAnd Porter made headlines during an October 2021 hearing where she blasted oil executives over how much federal land their companies have leased. In a live demonstration, Porter used candy and rice to show how much land the companies controlled.\n\n\"When you lobby and sue so that you can take more of our public land, you’re saying too much is never enough,\" Porter stated. \"The American people are tired of this charade.\"\n\nFinally, Schiff is the only candidate of the three Democrats to list climate change as a key issue on his campaign website. He argues in favor of the Green New Deal which he was an original cosponsor of, major new green investments, developing a \"green economy\" and leading the world in clean energy development.\n\n\"Climate change is real, our planet is on fire, and we must act. Now,\" he states on his website. \"That seems like common knowledge, but half of our country’s political structure still refutes that simple truth. And worse, refuses to act on it.\"\n\n\"The Green New Deal is not just a bold plan for addressing climate change and beginning to right the ship, it also is an urgent call to invest in growing a modern, green economy that is equitable and just for all,\" he adds.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOn Wednesday, he introduced legislation that would create a sustainable investment fund for federal employees that avoids oil, pharmaceutical tobacco investments. He said the bill would help federal workers use investments to boost \"sustainable practices that will help combat the climate crisis.\"\n\nHe also slammed Republicans for passing legislation that would rescind a Biden administration rule allowing fiduciaries to factor environmental considerations into Americans' retirement accounts, an action opponents have argued could significantly harm the interests of customers by placing social priorities over financial interests.",

            "description": "The Farmer-Citizen Movement party, or BoerBurgerBeweging, will take 15 seats, marking the largest single-party presence in the Dutch Senate for the coming term.",
            "content": "A young Dutch political party seeking to push back on the government's climate agenda achieved a stunning victory Wednesday as it won the most seats for a single party in the Dutch Senate.\n\n\"This isn't normal, but actually it is! It's all normal citizens who voted,\" party leader Caroline van der Plas said. \"But today people have shown they can't stay at home any longer. We won't be ignored anymore.\"\n\nThe Farmer-Citizen Movement Party, known as BoerBurgerBeweging (BBB) in Dutch, built its victory on the back of protests against the government’s environmental policies, which aim to slash nitrogen emissions by dramatically cutting back on livestock numbers and buying out thousands of farms. Nitrate and ammonia pollution significantly impacts biodiversity, particularly air and water quality.\n\nThe party appears on course to take 15 of the 75 Senate seats – more seats than Prime Minister Mark Rutte’s conservative VVD party – with almost 20% of the vote, according to the BBC. Rutte built his victory on the back of a four-party coalition, which will now control 24 seats overall.\n\nPOLAND PLANS TO SEND MIG-29 FIGHTER JETS TO UKRAINE FOLLOWING URGENT REQUESTS FROM THE WAR-TORN COUNTRY\n\n\"Now is the time to take citizens seriously. I am open to talks with everybody. We are ready,\" she added.\n\nAround 57.5% of voters turned out for the election, marking the greatest turnout in years.\n\nVoters argue that the government’s approach does not support the farmers, and the government’s plan is \"not good\" for them as it stands.\n\nHowever, the other big winner on the night was the Greens and center-left Labor Party coalition, an environmentally-focused group that argued that climate problems will not just go away. The left-leaning coalition also won 15 seats, tying BBB.\n\nThe results mainly indicate that Rutte’s remaining time in office may prove difficult as he faces a challenge to push through any legislation that needs Senate support.\n\nRutte congratulated BBB, saying party leader van der Plas \"looks like a big winner tonight,\" but he stressed that his coalition remains the majority power in the Senate.\n\nIn a comment to the Associated Press, Rutte downplayed the impact BBB’s victory might have on immediate proceedings in government.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I really think it’s elections for the provinces and water authorities,\" Rutte said. \"And of course also for the Senate, so in that sense, there is also something of national policy in it, but I would be careful about drawing very big conclusions from such a result.\"\n\nReuters and the Associated Press contributed to this report.",

The Farmer-Citizen Movement Party, known as BoerBurgerBeweging (BBB) in Dutch, built its victory on the back of protests against the government’s environmental policies, which aim to slash nitrogen emissions by dramatically cutting back on livestock numbers and buying out thousands of farms. The other big winner on the night was the Greens and center-left Labor Party coalition, an environmentally-focused group that argued that climate problems will not just go away. Around 57.5% of voters turned out for the election, marking the greatest turnout in years. Prime Minister Mark Rutte's coalition remains the majority power in the Senate.",

            "description": "Biden's foreign policy tries to avoid risk in a risky world. That jeopardizes American interests on everything from China relations to climate change.",
            "content": "President Joe Biden's foreign policy is a toxic mix of ideas from both extremes of the political spectrum.\n\nOn the one hand, Biden and company have embraced the Obama era policy of maximum restraint. The idea is that the less the U.S. engages in foreign affairs, the fewer problems it will have to deal with.\n\nThe problem with maximum restraint is that it can let a manageable foreign problem fester and grow into a tremendous problem. It’s like when a homeowner keeps putting off fixing a leaky roof; one day the ceiling will collapse.\n\nMaximum restraint can also lead to precipitous withdrawal from foreign engagements. This too can be disastrous. For example, Obama precipitously withdrew from Iraq, and ISIS promptly filled the vacuum. Biden did the same in Afghanistan, and we now know that Al Qaeda has already reestablished a foothold there.\n\nThe reality is: Whenever America walks away, our adversaries happily fill in. Just look at what happened at our southern border. As soon as Biden reversed all of Trump’s border security measures, the cartels started lining up people to come across.\n\nOn the other hand, Biden is often over-eager to engage on the world stage, turning American interests over to globalist management. The idea is that we can make the world safer, more equitable and more just if we follow the wisdom of global elites and govern according to international agreements on everything from climate policy and tax policy to labor policy and the treatment of women.\n\nThe problem with this is that it can sacrifice our national interests — and our sovereignty — abiding by international compacts that our enemies ignore, and our friends find preposterous. For example, the Chinese have zero intent of following the U.S. into the abyss of \"net zero\" green energy policy. To keep their economy growing, they are building coal plants right and left.\n\nYet, Biden persists in thinking that he and other leaders of developed nations can establish global \"norms\" by pledging to follow the dictates of Davos. This is like the little kid sitting in a grocery cart who thinks he is steering down the aisle.\n\nBy following these impulses to 1) do nothing and 2) tell everyone else what to do, Biden believes he is reducing risk and making a better world. In reality, what he has is a schizophrenic foreign policy that has increased global risk and left our friends and allies dazed and confused.\n\nThe most recent victim of this approach was House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Her trip to Taiwan was important. And the stakes were high. China is America’s No. 1 threat, and Taiwan is the most serious issue that divides us. One would think every step the president would take would be serious, deliberate and proactive, because that is how serious people deal with serious risks. Not Joe.\n\nHis first instinct was to try to make the problem go away. So, he asked Pelosi to cancel the visit. This would have been a big slap in the face to Taiwan and a huge loss of face for the U.S.\n\nWhen Pelosi refused, Biden then called Chinese President Xi Jinping and, after meekly reassuring him that the U.S. still clings to the \"One China Policy.\" asked him to back down from his regime’s saber-rattling rhetoric opposing the trip. Again, no effect.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nIndeed, throughout the crisis, Biden came across — to China, to Taiwan, to Pelosi and the rest of the world — as little more than a do-nothing Bystander-in-Chief. (Though, in fairness, he did tweet afterward.)\n\nOnce Pelosi left, China ramped-up its \"wolf warrior\" diplomacy ringing Taiwan with live fire drills. The administration response was mostly finger-waving at the Chinese, tut-tutting that they were not following the international norms as approved by our globalist overlords in Davos. Beijing must still be laughing.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBut this is no laughing matter. Just ask Ukraine. When Putin threatened to invade, Biden tried the mix of do nothing, threatening with a handful of sanctions, and finger-waving about international norms. Rather than being deterred, Russia started a war that has harmed our economy and lowered our national security.\n\nWhen will U.S. foreign policy get better instead of worse? The answer is: When the administration starts dealing with risks, rather than ignoring them.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JAMES JAY CARAFANO",

In reality, what he has is a schizophrenic foreign policy that has increased global risk and left our friends and allies dazed and confused. One would think every step the president would take would be serious, deliberate and proactive, because that is how serious people deal with serious risks. When will U.S. foreign policy get better instead of worse?",

            "description": "\"Outnumbered\" panelists criticized President Biden following his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, where he focused on climate change rather than COVID-19.",
            "content": "Critics are calling out President Biden for failing to address some key issues facing the U.S. during his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping Monday at the G-20. Rather than discuss the origins of COVID-19 or fentanyl coming from China, Biden opted to restart dialogue on climate change instead.\n\nAccording to a readout from the event, the two leaders also discussed economic competition, inflation and Taiwan. The \"Outnumbered\" panelists questioned why other serious topics were avoided.\n\nFormer State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus provided initial analysis, having attended high-level foreign meetings serving under President Trump. She began by commending the leaders for meeting for three and a half hours and praised their release of a joint statement condemning the use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine.\n\nBIDEN SAYS AFTER XI MEETING HE DOESN'T BELIEVE THERE IS ‘IMMINENT ATTEMPT’ FROM CHINA TO INVADE TAIWAN\n\nShe then noted that focusing on climate change was a \"huge mistake.\"\n\n\"Why are we not talking about fentanyl -- the chemical precursors that go from China to Mexico -- the number one killer of young people? Why aren't we talking about the origins of COVID-19?,\" she asked. \"Are we just going to let them get away with this?\"\n\nFox News contributor Brian Brenberg argued Biden’s approach came off as weak.\n\n\"All I see is President Xi in full-throttle domination mode on the world stage. And I'm watching our president walk into that, and he is not in a position of strength,\" Brenberg told the panel.\n\nHe then argued that, despite Ortagus’ commendations, Biden did nothing to move the United States into a position of power over China.\n\nFOX Business anchor Dagen McDowell went a step further in suggesting that President Xi treats America as inferior based on Biden’s policies.\n\n\"It's not too much to ask of the president of the United States to stand up for the surviving families of the more than a million Americans who died from COVID,\" she said.\n\nMcDowell argued that it’s not too late to discuss COVID origins, as Americans are still looking for answers. She called out the president, saying he gave \"antipathy\" to the country rather than empathy.\n\n\"Biden can't stand up for all of those families,\" she said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"But he can stand up in front of the world at the top of that press conference and humble brag about the Democrats’ victory in the midterms, which is exactly what he did.\"\n\nThe White House did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment on why COVID-19 or its origins was not discussed between the two leaders.",

            "content": "The Prince and Princess of Wales are traveling to Boston, Massachusetts, as part of the second annual Earthshot Prize Awards.\n\nWilliam and Kate will mark their first visit to the United States in eight years by joining alongside \"activists, innovators, policymakers and performers to celebrate the 2022 cohort of fifteen global Finalists before the five Winners are awarded\" at a ceremony on Dec. 2, according to a release from Kensington Palace.\n\n\"The Prince and Princess are looking forward to spending time in Boston, and to learning more about the issues that are affecting local people, as well as to celebrating the incredible climate solutions that will be spotlighted through The Earthshot Prize.\"\n\nSpeculation continues to grow that a \"Fab Four\" reunion could potentially be in the works. Days after the ceremony, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are scheduled to receive the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights (RFKHR) organization's Ripple of Hope Award Gala in New York.\n\nKING CHARLES ‘DEEPLY REGRETS’ MAKING PRINCE WILLIAM AND PRINCE HARRY WALK BEHIND THEIR MOTHER'S COFFIN: AUTHOR\n\nA spokesperson for the organization told Fox News Digital that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have confirmed their attendance at the gala on Dec. 6.\n\nPrince William and Kate Middleton's trip to the states begins Wednesday, Nov. 30 and concludes Dec. 2.\n\nPRINCE WILLIAM AND KATE MIDDLETON MAKE FIRST APPEARANCE TOGETHER IN WEEKS\n\n\"Inspired by President John F. Kennedy’s ‘Moonshot’, The Earthshot Prize is an ambitious global environmental prize which aims to discover, celebrate and scale the best solutions to help repair our planet.\"\n\nIn 2021, the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation announced that it had partnered with the Earthshot Prize. The inaugural Earthshot Prize award ceremony was held in London on Oct. 17, 2021. Emma Thompson, Emma Watson and David Oyelowo joined Kate in presenting the awards.\n\nTheir Royal Highnesses will \"get to know\" the city of Boston by meeting the mayor, Michelle Wu, at a special event. Prince William is also scheduled to visit the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum with Ambassador Caroline Kennedy.\n\n\"Recognising the significant challenges that the coastal city of Boston faces as a result of climate change, The Prince and Princess will see for themselves the work that local organisations are doing to mitigate the risk of rising sea levels,\" the release stated.\n\nPrince William and Kate will spend time learning about innovative technologies at the Greentown Labs, and also hear from those affected by climate-related challenges in the Boston area during a visit to Roca, a nonprofit \"working for nearly 35 years to bring public systems together in a cohesive approach to save and change the trajectory of the lives of high-risk young people.\"\n\nThe Princess of Wales will also visit the Center on the Developing Child at Harvard University as part of a long-standing relationship between The Royal Foundation and The Centre for Early Childhood.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nRFKHR announced in March that Harry and Meghan have been named this year's Ripple of Hope Award laureates along with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Siris Capital co-founder Frank Baker and Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan.\n\nThe Sussexes were chosen to receive the prestigious award in \"recognition of their work on racial justice, mental health, and other social impact initiatives through their Archewell Foundation,\" per a press release from the organization.\n\n\"When The Duke and Duchess accepted our award laureate invitation back in March, we were thrilled. The couple has always stood out for their willingness to speak up and change the narrative on racial justice and mental health around the world,\" Kerry Kennedy, president of Human Rights and Robert F. Kennedy's daughter, said in a statement.\n\nShe continued, \"They embody the type of moral courage that my father once called the 'one essential, vital quality for those who seek to change a world that yields most painfully to change.'\"\n\nRFKHR is a nonprofit human rights advocacy organization that was named after the late U.S. senator after he was assassinated in 1968.\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan departed from royal duties in 2020 and moved to the United States due to what they described as the British media's intrusion and racist demeanor toward their family.\n\nThey’ve rarely returned to the but attended the queen's funeral in September. Prior to Her Majesty's death, the couple appeared at the queen’s Platinum Jubilee in June, when they were present for one royal obligation during the five-day event before celebrating daughter Lilibet’s first birthday at Frogmore Cottage.\n\nDespite a rumored feud between the couples, William, Kate, Harry and Meghan made a surprise joint appearance together while on a walkabout to view floral tributes to the late following her death.\n\nOn Sept. 19, they attended Queen Elizabeth's funeral service where William and Harry walked side by side behind their grandmother's coffin as it was moved from Westminster Hall to Westminster Abbey.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",

            "description": "Sen. John Kennedy reacted Wednesday to New York Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's climate change-themed box office bomb, on Fox News' 'Hannity'.",
            "content": "New York Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez' climate change-themed box office bomb makes Louisiana Republican Senator John Kennedy appreciate billionaire industrialist Elon Musk and his contributions to America that much more, the GOP lawmaker told Fox News on Wednesday.\n\nKennedy said many of those who follow Ocasio-Cortez believe America to be \"wicked\" and the people behind the film – which grossed an estimated $80 per theater in its opening weekend – are part of an unhelpful \"media-entertainment-industrial-complex,\" he said.\n\n\"The movie about Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez makes me appreciate Elon Musk that much more,\" Kennedy said, adding that Ocasio-Cortez' film, like her far-left politics only present a view critical to the mainstream.\n\n\"Many of the congresswoman's supporters don't like America. They think America was wicked when it was founded. It's even more wicked today. They think the American people – or at least millions of them – are racist and misogynistic and ignorant,\" he went on.\n\nSBF WON'T BE THE LAST INDICTED IN THE FTX COLLAPSE: LAW PROFESSOR\n\nUnlike Ocasio-Cortez, Musk makes major, pivotal decisions every day that affect not only him but the rest of the nation in a way the South African-born billionaire hopes will instead strengthen America's founding principles, the lawmaker added.\n\n\"Many of these supporters of the congresswoman assign people to a status. They don't see us as individuals. But all White people, for example, they think are racists. All Black people they think are victims; all women are powerless. They don't see us as individuals. That's why I appreciate what Elon Musk has done so much,\" he said.\n\nMusk in turn has taken a \"courageous stand\" in favor of the First Amendment, Kennedy went on, appearing to reference his Twitter purchase and ensuing dump of files that purport to show rampant censorship and alignment with establishment and government forces.\n\nBENEFICIARIES OF ‘DIRTBAG’ SAM BANKMAN-FRIED'S FRAUDULENT, DIRTY MONEY MUST PAY IT BACK: PIRRO\n\n\"[Musk's critics] are beating on him like he stole Christmas, but he's tough. He's tough as a pine knot – and the man's got guts.\"\n\n\"He's got – he's got oranges the size of beachballs – and thanks to Elon Musk, we're going to have to get some new conspiracy theories because the other ones turned out all to be true,\" Kennedy added – pointing to the blowback many Twitter critics received when they claimed it was censoring conservatives and pro-Trump or anti-Biden voices.\n\nCLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPivoting to the Twitter files saga, Kennedy said many revelations show FBI Director Christopher Wray – a Trump appointee who formerly represented ex-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie during his George Washington BridgeGate scandal – should call a press conference to explain exactly what went on between the bureau and Twitter's erstwhile brass.\n\n\"Because, these e-mails on Twitter that have been revealed ought to make every Democrat and every Republican in America who believes in the First Amendment gag.\"",

            "description": "Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V., is reportedly \"livid\" that the Biden administration is rolling out the Inflation Reduction Act as climate change legislation.",
            "content": "Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V., is reportedly \"livid\" with how President Biden has begun implementing the Inflation Reduction Act, the major Democratic Party legislation that was signed into law only after the senator from West Virginia pledged to support it.\n\nEven though Manchin pledged support for the bill after months of debate with party members and the president on proposed legislation, Politico reported Thursday he has been \"raising hell\" on Capitol Hill over how the Biden administration is rolling it out.\n\nIn a blistering statement, the lawmaker torched Democrats who view the act as a vehicle to fight climate change rather than an \"energy securing measure.\" He called their perspective \"bulls***\" and accused them of seeking to \"starve\" Americans \"out of energy.\"\n\nPolitico’s recent report opened by stating, \"the West Virginia Democrat is livid about how his party’s president and his administration are rolling out a party-line bill that served as a crowning achievement for both men — and he’s particularly peeved at a delay in new guidelines on who gets the law’s generous electric vehicle tax credits.\"\n\nThe piece explained that Manchin has introduced a bill to \"halt the credits until Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen implements strict requirements for electric-vehicle battery sourcing,\" as he has been seeking a way to use to the credits \"to boost U.S.-manufactured rather than overseas-made vehicles.\"\n\nPolitico reported on a recent interview with the lawmaker, who claimed that talks over the legislation with the administration have been contentious. He said, \"I’ve been raising hell.\"\n\nBashing how the administration wants to implement the act’s EV tax credits, he claimed, \"They almost act like they gotta send $7,500 or a person won’t buy a car. Which is crazy, ludicrous thinking for the federal government.\"\n\nHe added, \"I just totally and absolutely am disagreeing with what they’re doing.\"\n\nManchin’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) grievances go beyond the EV tax credits. He sees his party promoting the law as a \"climate change-fighting one\" rather than an \"energy security measure\" he believes it truly is.\n\nPolitico noted that of late, Manchin has been touting \"the power of the bill he wrote in order to puncture Democratic hopes of ending U.S. reliance on fossil fuels.\"\n\nHe saved some harsh words for Democrats who would promote the law to make this transition. The outlet quoted him saying, \"This is bulls***. So they’re gonna basically starve us out of energy that we have a tremendous, abundant supply of because of their aspirational thoughts?\"\n\nHe added, \"I will continue to fight and I’ll do everything I can to make sure the public knows what they’re doing and what it will do to you and your economy and your lifestyle.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nManchin’s support for the IRA has proven controversial especially among his constituents in the red state of West Virginia. As the outlet noted, \"Manchin’s approval ratings back home took a hit after he supported the Inflation Reduction Act.\"\n\nVoters may have viewed Manchin signing onto the legislation as an act supportive of Democrats’ climate agenda. Though as one anonymous Manchin colleague told Politico, the senator earnestly believes that the law puts the U.S. \"on track to energy independence.\"",

Joe Manchin, D-W.V., is reportedly \"livid\" with how President Biden has begun implementing the Inflation Reduction Act, the major Democratic Party legislation that was signed into law only after the senator from West Virginia pledged to support it. Even though Manchin pledged support for the bill after months of debate with party members and the president on proposed legislation, Politico reported Thursday he has been \"raising hell\" on Capitol Hill over how the Biden administration is rolling it out. He called their perspective \"bulls***\" and accused them of seeking to \"starve\" Americans \"out of energy.\"\n\nPolitico’s recent report opened by stating, \"the West Virginia Democrat is livid about how his party’s president and his administration are rolling out a party-line bill that served as a crowning achievement for both men — and he’s particularly peeved at a delay in new guidelines on who gets the law’s generous electric vehicle tax credits.\" Politico noted that of late, Manchin has been touting \"the power of the bill he wrote in order to puncture Democratic hopes of ending U.S. reliance on fossil fuels.\"",

            "description": "The Biden admin accidentally leaked an internal memo last week raising questions about the White House's priorities regarding climate change and energy security.",
            "content": "One expert issued a stark warning to the Biden administration over its energy policy after a bombshell memo was leaked indicating climate change is being prioritized over what many critics call energy security.\n\nFormer U.S. Homeland Security Adviser Dr. Julia Nesheiwat warned the White House's energy stance will have long-term implications for the energy sector after the memo was accidentally leaked from the Department of the Interior last week.\n\nShe joined \"Fox & Friends Weekend,\" Sunday, to discuss how the energy policy hurts the U.S. domestically, and why the economic implications are self-inflicted as Americans battle rising prices.\n\n\"We are in a time of a global energy crisis and the fact that we're… dealing with global supply chain disruptions, the fact that… we have vast natural resources here in North America, and to be able to put one over the other… they're both important, of course, but… it's not zero-sum,\" Nesheiwat told co-host Rachel Campos-Duffy. \"It's not all or nothing, and so to be able to do that really hurts us here on the home front.\"\n\nIn the memo, leaked on Friday, the Biden administration admitted that less to drill would provide \"greater energy security\" despite its plans to hike royalty fees.\n\nFormer Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) Director Amanda Lefton recommended late last year that, as , the Department of the Interior (DOI) move forward with higher royalty fees for an oil and gas lease sale spanning 958,202 acres in the Cook Inlet off the coast of Alaska, according to the memo obtained by Fox News Digital. DOI Assistant Secretary Laura Daniel-Davis ultimately signed off on the recommendation.\n\n\"If a Cook Inlet prospect would be developed, there would be additional government revenues and greater energy security for the State of Alaska, especially if development of natural gas resources in the Cook Inlet ameliorated the long-term supply challenges facing the Anchorage area,\" Lefton wrote in the memo.\n\n\"Nevertheless, because of the serious challenges facing the Nation from climate change and the impact of [greenhouse gasses] from fossil fuels, BOEM is not recommending this option since it would not include an appropriate surcharge to account for those impacts,\" she continued.\n\nBIDEN ADMIN GIVES TOP ENERGY POST TO CLIMATE ACTIVIST WHO FAILED SENATE CONFIRMATION OVER ETHICS CONCERNS\n\nCritics have accused the Biden administration of stifling domestic energy production, while turning to foreign adversaries for energy, all in the name of climate change.\n\nAs a result, Americans have been battling rising prices at the pump as inflation sits at a four-decade high.\n\n\"When you think about what energy security is… it has to be… reliable, it has to be affordable, clean… so when you think about this… how could we not… help promote natural gas in this situation?\" she asked.\n\nNesheiwat reiterated the U.S. has a plethora of energy sources and other technological tools to bolster its domestic energy production, and energy security, as a result. \n\n\n\nBut bolstering domestic production and promoting climate-friendly initiatives don't need to be mutually exclusive, she argued.\n\n\"I can't emphasize enough that this will hurt us in the long run,\" Nesheiwat warned. \"Especially as we look at what's happening around the world… China, Russia dominating in the oil and gas sector and even in renewables, and the fact that we have to struggle here with higher energy prices when we have the solutions right here on the home front, when we have the technology and the innovation, when we can be investing more in nuclear, hydrogen or carbon capture… there are solutions that exist that should not be put one over the other.\"\n\n\n\n CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nChairman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources Senator Joe Manchin (D) issued a statement after the internal memo was leaked last week, slamming the White House for \"putting their radical climate agenda ahead of the needs of the people of Alaska and the United States.\"\n\nHe said he was \"appalled\" by the content.\n\n\"The contents of this memo speak volumes - if this is what this Administration truly believes and is how they are going to make decisions, it is unacceptable,\" Manchin said. \"It’s a clear and intentional threat to energy security and the all-of-the above energy policy Congress has consistently reinforced.\"",

            "description": "Iran protests spread as demonstrators demand change and cheaper food  Fox News",
            "content": "Protests spread to more parts of Iran Friday, as ordinary Iranians demanded the government reinstate subsidies on food that have seen prices soar since they began earlier this week. Observers also note that the protests have taken on a pointedly more anti-regime tone in the last 48 hours.\n\nVideos shared on social media show protesters shouting anti-regime slogans, and in two separate cases, attacking the offices of the much feared Basij paramilitary militia. Other images shown on The Foreign Desk website shows a red vehicle purportedly spraying protesters with an unknown fluid, possibly tear gas.\n\nProtesters, showing no fear of retribution by the state security services have been heard shouting \"Death to Khamenei! Death to Raisi!\" referring to Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, who has promised to create jobs, lift sanctions, and rescue the economy.\n\nIRAN PROTESTS BREAK OUT ACROSS THE COUNTRY AMID SKYROCKETING FOOD PRICES\n\nLisa Daftari, an expert on Iran and editor-in-chief of the news website The Foreign Desk, told Fox News Digital that the protests have spread to several more of Iran's 31 provinces including Khuzestan, Lorestan, Kurdistan, Isfahan, Kermanshah, Hamedan, Sistan, Rasht, Azerbaijan, Chaharmahal Bakhtiari and Shahrekord and Ardabil.\n\nDaftari stated that, \"In the past decade the Iranian people have done a wonderful job acting as citizen journalists to tell the world what the true plight of the Iranian people is, and how misrepresented their regime is in the mainstream media. While the Biden administration, similar to the Obama administration, is busy obfuscating the facts about a brutal and repressive regime that is not interested in changing its ways, the people of Iran are suffering. They are telling us their true stories.\"\n\nThe Associated Press, citing reports from Iran's state-run news agency IRNA, stated that some 22 protesters had been arrested since last night. The Iranian UN mission in New York did not immediately return Fox News Digital's request for comment.\n\nAs the protests continue the Biden administration is still seeking to rejoin the Iran Nuclear Deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA.) While there is growing opposition in Congress to the U.S. going back to the deal, the administration is continuing to push for a return to it. The deal was signed by President Obama in 2015, and President Trump withdrew the U.S. from the deal in 2018.\n\nIn a week that saw two European citizens arrested on espionage charges in Iran, Reuters news agency reported Friday that a State Department official said that the U.S. appreciated the efforts being shown by the EU in its efforts to reinvigorate the deal. Negotiations have stalled in recent weeks.\n\nBehnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies (FDD), and an expert on Iran told Fox News Digital the protests were part of a larger anti-government trend.\n\n\"It would be yet another mistake to view these protests as isolated or merely economic. They are part of a growing trend of anti-regime protests that use social, economic, and environment matters to make claims about their desire for responsible and representative government,\" he said.\n\nHe said the administration needs to take note of what's going on. \"Just over a decade ago, some slogans chanted by Iranian protests about death to the Supreme Leader or in favor of Iran's past monarchial dynast would have been taboo. Now they are commonplace. Washington can ill afford to ignore this transition,\" he said.\n\nIran abruptly raised prices as much as 300% for a variety of staples such as cooking oil, chicken, eggs and milk on Thursday. Scores of alarmed Iranians waited in long lines to snatch up bundles of food and emptied supermarket shelves across the country in the hours before the price hike took effect.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAlthough Iran produces roughly half of its own wheat, it imports much of the rest from Russia. The war has added to inflationary pressures.\n\nThe government is trying to act swiftly to blunt the pain. Authorities have promised to pay every Iranian citizen some $14 a month to compensate for the price hikes.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\nTUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Oh, we are out of time and no one sadder about it than we are. You probably want a break. By the way, you can watch a conversation on FOX Nation. If you like, you head to TuckerCarlson.com.\n\n\n\nWe'll be back tomorrow night at 8:00 p.m. and every weeknight. The show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink.\n\n\n\nAnd now to the great Sean Hannity.\n\n\n\nSEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: All right. And thank you, Tucker.\n\n\n\nAnd welcome to HANNITY.\n\n\n\nAnd, tonight, we are tracking multiple major stories including big news from Canada.\n\n\n\nNow, the country's pathetic prime minister is still in hiding as the peaceful trucker protest gains tons of momentum despite GoFundMe trying to steal their donations or not dispense the money that people generously gave to them despite a new injunction making it illegal for people and truckers and supporters to honk their horns. We'll explain all of it. We'll get to the scene as well tonight.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, back here at home, top Democrats, they're getting rightfully slammed over their disgusting mask hypocrisy.\n\n\n\nBut, first, we're now beginning week two of the left's all-out -- well, attack on Joe Rogan. Boycott, fire, cancel, wash, rinse, repeat. Over the weekend, a far-left group released a montage of Rogan saying the N-word over the years on his podcast.\n\n\n\nLet's state up front, this is simple. It's not a hard one. It's a word nobody should use ever. Rogan addressed it immediately. He apologized profusely. He said the clips were taken out of context.\n\n\n\nHere's what he said.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nJOE ROGAN, PODCASTER: I'm making this video to talk about the most regretful and shameful thing that I've ever had to talk about publicly. There's a video that's out that's a compilation of me saying the N-word. It's a video that's made of clips taken out of context of me of 12 years of conversations on my podcast.\n\n\n\nNow, I know that to most people, there's no context where a white person is ever allowed to say that word never mind publicly on a podcast. And I agree with that now. I haven't said it in years, but for a long time when I would bring that word up, like if it would come up in conversation, instead of saying the N-word I would just say the word. I thought as long as it was in context, people would understand what I was doing.\n\n\n\nLike that context was part of the clip we were talking about Red Fox. How Red Fox said that word on television in the 1970s and how times have changed so much since then. Or about how Richard Pryor used it as one of the titles of one of his albums.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nHANNITY : This raises a lot of questions tonight, how will the country -- the marketplace respond to comedians, let's say, Chris Rock, for example, who used the word a lot on stage? Time will tell.\n\n\n\nIf Rogan had said nobody should ever use this word and said the word in that context, would people be as upset? Should they be?\n\n\n\nNow, I've not listened to any of the podcasts mentioned in the montage, but Rogan admits he's wrong, said he's embarrassed. He regrets it.\n\n\n\nHis apology does sound sincere, kind of like Whoopi Goldberg's apology for her comments on the Holocaust. Well, to me, it was sincere. I know her well enough over the years. I know she's absolutely not anti-Semitic and my rock solid support for Israel, and the Jewish people is well known. I wouldn't tolerate an anti-Semite or a racist.\n\n\n\nBut again, this is the great thing about freedom. If you don't like any of these shows, you don't have to watch them. You don't like Whoopi Goldberg, you don't like Joe Rogan, turn the channel. No one can force you to watch.\n\n\n\nSadly with many on the left, all they want to do is silence, cancel, boycott and end all dissent. Most people also feign outrage when they're not actually offended. They're using censorship as a political tool, often to cancel conservatives.\n\n\n\nNow, think about this: Joe Biden, he's the president of the United States. He ran for president for over a year. He's not a podcast host. He's not the co-host on a talk show and yet, he's never ever apologized for his years of frankly downright racist rhetoric and actions. As a senator, we've told you very few people ever pay attention, didn't even come up except for Kamala Harris in one debate.\n\n\n\nHe worked with segregationists. He worked with a former Klansman to stop integration of public schools and busing. He's worried that children would go to public schools that are, quote, in his words a racial jungle. His mentor in the U.S. Senate was a former Klansman.\n\n\n\nDuring a hearing in the `80s, he himself used the N-word multiple times uncensored, while reading a quote. He more recently proclaimed that you have to have a slight Indian accent if you want to work at a Dunkin Donuts or 7-Eleven in his state. He also referred to Obama as the, quote, the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean. This is storybook, man.\n\n\n\nNo other African-American before, Joe, was articulate bright and clean? This is the first time?\n\n\n\nHe bragged at his home state of Delaware, my state's a slave state, he said. And in Virginia, he'd don that fake African-American accent, told the crowd that Mitt Romney is going to put y'all back in chains.\n\n\n\nBiden's son Hunter, long-time crack addict, frequently used the N-word and text messages with his attorneys. Is there anyone on the left that was as outraged that the president of the United States his son and he himself with his racial history, meaning Joe, is anybody offended anyone speak out? How often did you hear about it?\n\n\n\nIf you're a Democrat, if your last name is Clinton, Biden, no outrage from the Democratic left. There's no calls for boycotts, cancellations or censoring at all, whatsoever.\n\n\n\nIf you're a conservative or God forbid you have the last name Trump, I think the reaction we all know would be very different. The last time I checked, the president of the United States is a lot more powerful than a podcast host no matter how popular that host may be.\n\n\n\nBy the way so is the new mayor of New York City. His name is Eric Adams. No one's calling for his cancelling, his firing, his -- or even of an apology that I've heard for these comments.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nMAYOR ERIC ADAMS, NEW YORK CITY: Every day in the police department, I kicked those crackers' ass, man. I was unbelievable in the police department with one of the Black law enforcement. Came a sergeant, a lieutenant and the captain, you know, the stories.\n\n\n\nI would rather wear white all day, grow a big, smoke some weed and leave this stuff alone. Really?\n\n\n\nMan, you think rose boy, you think they wake up every day and unlike themselves? They're going to beat me up. The people who say, where's our real black leaders, they're going to say, listen, who's Eric? You know, why does everything, he should be mayor (ph), well, Negro, you run.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nHANNITY: Mayor Adams later apologized. Did he mean it? As with everyone else, time will tell. There are now -- there were no calls for him to be canceled in any way. There wasn't even a lot of criticism.\n\n\n\nYou know, how far back do we go here? We're going to talk about Howard Stern in the -- in the `80s. What about the times all these people dressed in blackface on many occasions, said many things that they wouldn't say today.\n\n\n\nDo we need to go back through the archives of anybody and everybody that might have said something that through today's prism is different? I don't think the answer is yes. What about Jimmy Kimmel, Madonna, Quentin Tarantino? Their use of the N-word, Pulp Fiction in that case.\n\n\n\nWhat about the hundreds of songs right now on Spotify that probably degrade women, call them derogatory names? Are there any other songs glorifying violence and murder and drugs? They use the N-word.\n\n\n\nTo their credit, Spotify says they're not canceling Joe Rogan, at least not as of today. If they do, the growing streaming platform rumble, they've offered Rogan $100 million to make the switch. Now, whether you like Joe Rogan or not, there is a good sign that there is a movement in this country that's willing to accept the idea of freedom and turning the channel and not being forced to listen or watch something that you find offensive.\n\n\n\nAnd that's why I'm so adamant about this. Why? Because it's a very simple reason, nobody can force you. You get to decide. You have full control of this.\n\n\n\nNow, not everyone agrees. You got fake news CNN, they would love for Rogan to be ripped off the airwaves. Of course, no one watches CNN, and their dear leader is now long gone.\n\n\n\nAnd now as one guest told Humpty Dumpty over the weekend, I would be nervous if I was at CNN after Mr. Potato Head's ouster. And according to \"The Wall Street Journal,\" multiple hosts are lashing out. Humpty is in a panic, putting his resume together in all likelihood. Take a look.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nBRIAN STELTER, CNN HOST: And you can draw a straight line from Andrew Cuomo's downfall to Zucker's. It is almost Shakespearean. But the people who say we're lacking journalism, that we've become an all talk channel, that we've run off and we're all opinions all the time, that Jeff Zucker led us astray, those people aren't watching CNN. They're not watching CNN.\n\n\n\nThey're watching complaints about CNN on other channels that don't know what they're talking about. That's the truth.\n\n\n\nWe lost our leader this week but we're not going anywhere. So we'll see you back here next week.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nHANNITY: They're not watching CNN. First time he stumbled on the truth.\n\n\n\nBut really, what do you expect from Jeff Zucker's stenographer?\n\n\n\nNow, of course, Humpty is not a journalist nor is fake Jake news Tapper or Don Lemon. They're all opinion hosts, talk show hosts just like me except I'm honest. They are like me, members of the press for sure. They're not fair and balanced journalists.\n\n\n\nAnd by the way, if you're one of the few that do watch CNN for any length of time, you'll know it's true. Look at Jeffrey Toobin, recently masturbating on a Zoom call in front of his coworkers. He's not a journalist either.\n\n\n\nFake news Jim Acosta who just called a called Virginia soviet style police state, that's journalism? That's not an opinion? Because they ended mass mandates? Yeah, not journalism.\n\n\n\nIn the daytime, more opinion from other Trump-hating obsessed Democrats that they say are journalists. They're not. They're talk shows. They're members of the press, they're talk show hosts. They occasionally do straight news, but they give a lot a lot of opinion.\n\n\n\nThen we got Jonah Goldberg, by the way, he just joined fake news CNN. The anti-Trump pundit is now so desperate for a platform that he joined CNN three years after tweeting this meme right there. Yikes!\n\n\n\nNow, we can go on and on and on. Straight news has been extinct for a long time over there, all hosts pretty much now giving their opinion. But here's this thing, fake news CNN still pretends that all of these hosts are nonpartisan journalists. They're not. They're talk show hosts, they're giving their opinion.\n\n\n\nWhich reminds me of a famous Russian quote, we know they are lying, they know that they are lying, they know we know they are lying and we know they know we know they are lying but they're still lying. This is fake news CNN.\n\n\n\nNow, I don't call for anyone to be fired, but if I were Humpty Dumpty, now, I'd probably be sweating a little more than he usually does.\n\n\n\nHere with more, author of \"Here's the Deal,\" Kellyanne Conway. Her book is out very soon, along with FOX News contributor Leo 2.0 Terrell.\n\n\n\nAll right. Leo, let's get your overall broad view of Rogan and this tape that came out the montage that came out. His response to it, Spotify's response to it, and what do we do -- are there going to be exceptions like does Chris Rock that continue to do his act?\n\n\n\nLEO TERRELL, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Thank you for asking that question. Listen, let me -- bravo for Spotify for sticking behind Joe Rogan.\n\n\n\nAnd let me tell you right now, the only reason why the left is upset with Joe Rogan, it's not because of N-word. He's not on their team. He's not on their team. He's not one of their guys, and therefore, they want to control Joe Rogan.\n\n\n\nYou gave a beautiful montage of the Democrats using the N-word, the racial animus. All those individuals, they're on the team. They're on the Democratic team. If you are a Democrat, you can get away with that.\n\n\n\nJoe Rogan, they are upset with him because of the fact he's not on their team. Let me -- you missed one last point.\n\n\n\nRemember what Biden said, hey, if you don't -- if you vote for Trump, you ain't black. How dare him? He is a racist, but it's okay because he's on the Democratic team.\n\n\n\nAnd that CNN montage, same thing. All those guys are agents, Zucker on down, agents of the Democratic Party. They were the people behind Andrew Cuomo, but Joe Rogan, I'm glad he is still on Spotify. And I accept his apology because I know was taken out of context and they're out to get him because of the fact he is a free agent, not on their team.\n\n\n\nHANNITY: How is it Kellyanne that you look at Joe Biden's racial history, you look at what Kamala attacked him on during that one debate for example. Then you look at Hunter Biden using the N-word again and again and again, barely anybody showed any offense whatsoever to the president's son doing that.\n\n\n\nWhat if it was Donald Trump's son on tape saying it, an email saying it?\n\n\n\nKELLYANNE CONWAY, FORMER SENIOR COUNSELOR TO PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, they're just a bunch of hypocrites as you know. I really have to commend the way Joe Rogan handled this. His apology is sincere. He's asking for mercy and redemption. People should grant it.\n\n\n\nAnd I also have to give a lot of credit to someone I've never met, which is the CEO of Spotify, this Daniel Ek. I mean, he basically said I disagree with the content, I'm glad Joe has removed it. And by the way, we're not going to go any further. We're not going to cancel or censor people because of something that they've said and apologize for it in isolated incidents. That's not what's in somebody's heart. Why don't we cancel people according to what's in their heart, not an errant word here or there?\n\n\n\nIt reminds me of what John Carp, the head of Simon Schuster said when last year he had a lot of people in the company saying, you know, all the wokesters saying don't publish conservatives, and he said, we come to work every day to publish not to cancel. And I think that's the way to look at this.\n\n\n\nNow, on these comments about race, don't forget that it was Joe Biden who also described his primary opponent in 2008, Barack Obama as a clean articulate.\n\n\n\nHANNITY: It was story book, man.\n\n\n\nCONWAY: It was just wild, Harry Reid, right.\n\n\n\nHANNITY: Yeah.\n\n\n\nCONWAY: Yeah, and what about -- and what about Harry Reid? God rest his soul, but he had said that to Mark Halperin in that book called \"Game Change\". I mean, he really insulted President Obama based on his race. He thought he was complimenting him but there's no other way to read it.\n\n\n\nThe difference is, are you Republican or Democrat? You're a conservative or liberal? And that's what's happened to CNN. You know, CNN's problem is not that it based its business model around Jeff Zucker.\n\n\n\nCNN's problem is that it based his business model around Donald Trump. They left the podiums open for 30 minutes in March of 2016. In 2015, over a two- week period, 78 percent of their political coverage was about Donald Trump, even though 16 other Republicans were running.\n\n\n\nI can -- I can forgive them for not wanting to show us more Hillary and Bernie Sanders. But 78 percent of the coverage went to Donald Trump. They gave the Trump campaign -- I know it, I was on their every day on that network every day, up to $5 billion of free coverage.\n\n\n\nThen we get into office, instead of saying that the media and the White House have joint custody of the country for four years, Sean and Leo, how can we work together, 93 percent of the coverage, according to Harvard University, 93 percent of the coverage of Trump in the first days was negative. Now their ratings are down 90 percent year after year.\n\n\n\nSo they built their model Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump. And for all the reasons that you already mentioned, but I think race has been a big part of that too. They love to call the race card. I write in my book, you'll see very quickly, abortion used to be what all the Democrats talked about in their last convention in 2020, they ignored that. They talked about race, not abortion.\n\n\n\nHANNITY: Leo, let me go back to you with a final question. It's -- and I said it's a bad idea for anyone to say it, even in the context of you saying, saying it is evil, okay? Joe said in his statement as a white person, I should not say this word.\n\n\n\nWhat would you say -- what does this mean going forward for somebody like Chris Rock who I think is funny as hell?\n\n\n\nTERRELL: I'll tell you right now, no one should say the word, but I'm going to tell you right now, it depends on what side you're on. I mean -- I mean, there's no -- that's never going to go away. Should the word be used? No.\n\n\n\nCan it be used? Yes. Who's going to use it? Those on the left who will condone that type of activity but attack others if they're not on that side.\n\n\n\nAnd one last point about Eric Adams. That guy was in a position of power when he used that term white cracker. That's what -- that's one thing to be a podcast and give an opinion, that guy used his power to hate white American white crackers. That's a difference. I don't forgive him. I do not forgive Eric Adams.\n\n\n\nHANNITY: All right. Kellyanne, looking forward to your book.\n\n\n\nTERRELL: I want to be clear about that.\n\n\n\nHANNITY: And Leo good to have you. Books out soon. We'll tell you when it does.\n\n\n\nAll right. Now we turn to Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez who just proudly announced the capitalism just is not a redeemable system for us. Really? Take a look.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nREP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY6): To me, capitalism at its core what we're talking about when we talk about that is the absolute pursuit of profit at all human environmental and social cost. That is what we're really discussing. To me that is not a redeemable system for us to be able to participate in, for the prosperity and peace for the vast majority of people.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nHANNITY: Here with reaction, Senator Marco Rubio who, by the way, just introduced legislation that would ban the use of arrest papers as identification for illegal immigrants at airports.\n\n\n\nThe fact that you have to bring that as legislation is a little mind- numbing.\n\n\n\nSEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL): Yeah.\n\n\n\nHANNITY: You know, there's a very large -- and we were down in Miami together. We did this town hall, there's a very large Cuban American community, vibrant community in Miami. And -- I mean, the people that suffered under the Castro regime I know have a very, very different opinion than AOC on this issue of capitalism, the greatest wealth-producing system for anybody that wants to work hard and drive themselves to success.\n\n\n\nRUBIO: Yeah, I mean, I'm not surprised by those comments. Those comments are now the mainstream of the Democratic Party, and either people believe that, or they have to pretend they believe in some of their policies do. You know, they woke up one day and I guess decided that Marxism was right all along and that the Cold War should have never ended.\n\n\n\nAnd I don't understand how people that feel that way don't just move to one of these other countries. There's so many other countries out there that actually agree with that sentiment about socialism being better than capitalism.\n\n\n\nIn the real world, the world I come from, the neighborhood that I grew up in the people I've grown up around my family, capitalism is not these big corporations. Capitalism is the small business owner, it's the person that started it out of the -- you know, basement of their -- of their home or their garage and now owns a small business and employs four people. That's not possible in any other system but the capitalist free enterprise system.\n\n\n\nThat's the only system in the world that's ever been possible where someone can come here legally from another country and in a short period of time be the owner of a business and control their own economic destiny provide for their families and jobs for others like them.\n\n\n\nSo, look, I think it's a great debate to have, we should have it. And it's important to reinvigorate in every generation the belief in capitalism. But this -- this sort of rejection of it and this embraces socialism by the congresswoman you just said -- I mean, that that's now the mainstream of the Democratic Party.\n\n\n\nHANNITY: The -- so she wants this Green New Deal which would basically be, you know, cradle to grave, womb to the tomb redistribution of wealth. My question is, I have a hard time understanding where this belief that government can be successful?\n\n\n\nNow, the same government that bankrupted Social Security and Medicare, they're both headed for insolvency. There was no lock box. They raided the lock box and squandered the money.\n\n\n\nThe same people that destroyed our school system in many towns and cities across the country, the same people that promise keep your doctor, keep your care and save money, while millions lost their doctors, millions lost their care, and we're all paying about 200 plus percent more. The same people that can't keep law and order.\n\n\n\nWhy would we trust them with any other aspect of our daily lives?\n\n\n\nRUBIO: Because socialism is not about economics. It's a big mistake that we make it. Socialism has nothing to do but it's about power. It's about the ability to control people.\n\n\n\nIf you control where people work, if you control how much they make, if you control who owns what, then you can control what they say. You can control who they hire. You can control what they can sell, what they can do, what hours they can open.\n\n\n\nIt's about power. It's about control. That's what socialism has always been about.\n\n\n\nSocialism ultimately is not possible. The socialism she's talking about and they talk about it's really not possible without a government that actually controls every aspect of your life, because -- and that's why I think -- I don't think they're that troubled by inflation.\n\n\n\nI think they like the fact that inflation's run amok and that prices are high because that just means that they can come in with the argument that you see, the market can't provide for your needs, only a government check can, only government guarantee can. It plays right into their hands.\n\n\n\nBut again, socialism is not about economics. It's about power. It's about control.\n\n\n\nThat's why people flee. That's why Miami, you know, has inherited 800,000 to a million people from Latin America who flee socialism because it fails and it destroys lives.\n\n\n\nHANNITY: I'll quote Ronald Reagan and end the segment with government is the problem.\n\n\n\nSenator, always great to have you. Thank you for being with us.\n\n\n\nStraight ahead, we have a live reporter on the ground in Ottawa tonight. Things are heating up there. Freedom convoy truckers, they continue to pledge. They will stand against these draconian vaccine mandates. That's next, straight ahead.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nHANNITY: Support continues to pour in tonight for the Canadian truckers as they stand up for human dignity, liberty freedom, medical privacy, but to the left, anybody that stands against one-size-fits-all medicine with no exceptions whatsoever and for prosperity, they immediately become you know enemy number one.\n\n\n\nGet this, an Ottawa judge has actually granted an injunction to stop honking your horn in downtown Ottawa as momentum for this convoy continues to grow and grow and grow. Now, the truckers from what we can tell, they have been peaceful. We've not heard of any incidents of violence. Honking is part of how they are making their voices heard. Ask yourself this, you know, where's Trudeau and his left wing minions. Are they really outraged over honking a horn?\n\n\n\nAnd, of course, failed far left excuse for a leader Trudeau, he remains cowering in fear, nowhere to be found, calling the truckers every name he can in the book, still refusing to hear them out, address their valid concerns. Joe Biden doesn't know what day of the week it is and Trudeau is just a gutless, spineless child.\n\n\n\nHe's in way over his head. Instead, he claims truckers are racist and transphobic, despite no evidence that we could find of any of that. I've yet to see anything.\n\n\n\nAnd here with the very latest, live on the ground in Ottawa, we have Rebel News reporter Lincoln Jay.\n\n\n\nLincoln, from what I can see here in the States, this is staying strong, rock solid, they're not caving and they're not going anywhere.\n\n\n\nLINCOLN JAY, VIDEO JOURNALIST FOR REBEL NEWS: Yeah, the -- we -- I've been on the ground here since the 28th of January and it's become quite clear at this point that the truckers are not going anywhere. We've seen pretty much exactly the same amount of trucks on the ground here in Ottawa. None have left, considering there's a state of emergency now in the city. And like I said, it's become quite clear that they're not going anywhere anytime soon.\n\n\n\nHANNITY: Well -- and the support they're getting from the people seems fairly universal, almost seems like a street a block party what we call in New York.\n\n\n\nJAY: Yeah, it's -- the best way to describe it is -- it's like -- it's like a Canada Day festival every day here. It's nothing but positivity on the streets. I would honestly describe it as a family environment and that's why it makes it -- it's really hard to wrap your head around the way that the legacy media here in Canada is trying to spin the narrative and really turn this into something it's not.\n\n\n\nYou -- when you're on the ground here, you really see people from all walks of life that just want their freedoms back. It's been really hard to be a Canadian for the past almost two years, you know? And people just want these mandates lifted and that's why the truckers are here, and the truckers have brought a lot of hope to Canadians that we might actually see these mandates lifted. So, here we are.\n\n\n\nHANNITY: All right. Lincoln Jay, appreciate the report. Thank you.\n\n\n\nAlso tonight, we're following the efforts by the left and their allies to censor the trucker convoy like GoFundMe. They actually froze and gave no good explanation as to why and shut down the fundraising page, which had amassed over million dollars, trying to claim the convoy was connected to violence which again there's little to no evidence that we have found to support this phony allegation. But GoFundMe had no problem promoting the Seattle CHOP, CHAZ, Summer of Love zone back in May.\n\n\n\nThis is the -- I don't know trucker's winter summer of -- winter love zone, I don't know. Anyway in 2020, that CHAS, CHOP, Summer of Love zone was plagued with violence, plagued with lawlessness. That's not the scene here.\n\n\n\nAfter heavy pressure, GoFundMe now says they will issue refunds. Attorneys generals all along with Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, they're demanding answers and rightly raising questions about possible deceptive trade practices.\n\n\n\nHere with reaction all of this is former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee.\n\n\n\nBig difference between the summer of 2020 and what I see here, Governor, is that they are peaceful and that they are getting the support of people. They haven't taken over, you know, police precincts and city blocks, but they are making their voices heard and they have the support of the people. Your reaction?\n\n\n\nMIKE HUCKABEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, first of all, these are people who are not stealing things from local stores and burning and looting and robbing. These are people who are making their voices known. You know, it's interesting that some of the socialists of Canada are most offended by this. They might want to remember the words of Karl Marx, workers of the world unite.\n\n\n\nThat's exactly what these truckers have done and they have united Canadians and frankly they've united Americans south of their border. And people appreciate the fact that these very people who two years ago were hailed as the heroes of the pandemic continuing to deliver the things that we had to have, facing down the pandemic in every kind of way. And now, Trudeau thinks that they're the enemy.\n\n\n\nAnd I cannot help but remember that it was a year and a half ago when you had the CNN reporter standing in front of a burning fire and he says, yeah, the protests here are mostly peaceful. Come on.\n\n\n\nHANNITY: Yeah, the city block was on fire, you know, or there was a moment where MSDNC had a reporter in the CHAS, CHOP zone and making a comment like, oh this is mostly peaceful, somebody, no, we're not -- no, no, that's not the case here, being corrected live on air.\n\n\n\nThere's something deeper here because we see these protests all across Europe. Now, we're going to have a trucker convoy here in the U.S. and they've already raised a couple of million dollars I read today. And they're going to drive straight to Washington, D.C.\n\n\n\nAnd I think, my read on it is people have had it, any -- the argument over the vaccine is pretty much over. You've decided, you've listened to all sides, and you've made your own personal decision. And also people feel -- especially in the U.S. like they've been lied to.\n\n\n\nThat we were told originally, if you get the vaccine, you're not -- you're not going to get COVID. Wrong.\n\n\n\nWe're told there won't be vaccine mandates. Wrong.\n\n\n\nWe were told masks don't work, then one mask works, then two masks, then vax or mask, and vax and mass, then vax and mask and booster, and nobody ever talks about therapeutics now that we have breakthrough cases for people vaccinated, boostered and with natural immunity.\n\n\n\nHUCKABEE: Well, and the lockdowns don't work, and that's what the Johns Hopkins study did come up with.\n\n\n\nWhat makes this a really delicate situation for the left is that they claim to be the party and the voice of the blue collar, of the working man. Well, you don't get any more blue collar and working man than people who drive the trucks, who deliver the things that we desperately need and get them from coast to coast. This is the very heart and soul of the working class of Canada or America.\n\n\n\nSo when you start saying that these are bad evil people, now who do you go to and say you're fighting for? If you start fighting against them and then you have a GoFundMe site that steals the money of the people who gave it, many of whom I'm sure did not give it out of wealth but out of their own poverty, and then you defraud them by telling them they can give it for one thing and yet they take it for something else until they get caught red- handed, then they say, oh, no, we'll give it back to you.\n\n\n\nBut that's what makes this a very sticky point for the left and I think they have stepped into a pile of it that they're not going to be able to get out of no matter how -- how big their boots are.\n\n\n\nHANNITY: You know, it's interesting, they were the heroes. All the -- all the medical workers were the heroes just over -- you know, a year and a half ago. The media ignores completely the science of John Hopkins, you can't even make this up.\n\n\n\nGovernor, always great to see you. Thank you for being with us.\n\n\n\nWhen we come back, Joe Biden's DOJ actually going to enable people to use hard drugs. Really?\n\n\n\nPlus, Congress -- wait until you see this ad. Congressman Mike Waltz and an NBA player talking about creating an ad that exposes the ongoing genocide in China. Maybe you should call -- I don't know -- the communist Chinese Biden genocide Olympics.\n\n\n\nAnd by the way, nobody's watching. And the skiing and all the stuff on snow, it's fake snow. They don't even have real snow, straight ahead.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nHANNITY: We're learning tonight, the Biden Justice Department is signaling it is willing to give the green light to the so-called use of safe injection sites where users can shoot up heroin and use other drugs. Brilliant.\n\n\n\nHere to explain live from West Coast newsrooms, our own Trace Gallagher.\n\n\n\nReally, Trace, we're going to enable people to slowly commit suicide?\n\n\n\nTRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: And, Sean, this is an astounding about-face, especially when you consider that just last year, the DOJ fought against this thing. That's when a Pennsylvania federal appeals court ruled against opening these so-called safe injection sites.\n\n\n\nThe court said it would violate a 40-year-old drug law that targets crack houses and other illegal drug sites. But now, the DOJ might be willing to allow places where you go in, shoot up heroin and other narcotics and go out.\n\n\n\nUnder Bill de Blasio, New York City opened up two of what they call overdose prevention centers and the city maintains these sites have saved more than a hundred lives, people from overdosing. But critics counter that by saying the best way to save tens of thousands of live is put drug dealers behind bars and help addicts get medical help to overcome addiction.\n\n\n\nWe should note that while New York City is the only official drug injection sites in the country, many cities and states have been operating these types of drug dens for years. And now, the White House drug czar, Dr. Rahul Gupta, says he is interested in the data behind these injection sites, which gives you, kind of an idea, Sean, of where this whole thing is going -- Sean.\n\n\n\nHANNITY: It sounds like madness to me. Trace Gallagher in the west coast newsroom, thank you.\n\n\n\nNow, the Biden communist Chinese genocide Olympics, they are off to a rough start, as viewership for the opening ceremony down a whopping 43 percent compared to 2018. And why is team Biden continuing to down play the atrocities committed by the Chinese communist party? Why is Nancy Pelosi telling our athletes to cower and don't dare speak up because they might get mad at you, and Joe saying, oh, they just have different norms than we do here.\n\n\n\nForced labor, genocide, different norms, Joe? That's how you're going to characterize that? Maybe you tell President Xi, we won't pay them a single penny that we owe them. I want to take that money, we're going to compensate every single family in this country that lost a loved one from COVID. I'd respect that decision.\n\n\n\nDoes anyone doubt at this point that with all of the money the Biden family foreign syndicate made from China, more recently revealed in Peter Schweizer's book, $31 million, $1.5 billion Bank of China deal that Beijing doesn't have a massive leverage just like Russia and Ukraine over the Biden family? The whole Biden family has to be compromised by China, Russia and Ukraine.\n\n\n\nWhy are they silent on the treatment of the Uighur minority Muslim community and censorship, and China's push for reunification, in other words, taking over Taiwan? And, of course, their crackdown and oppression in Hong Kong.\n\n\n\nAnd as an aside, why on the Earth are the Winter Olympics in China? They don't even have snow. They are using fake snow for the Olympics.\n\n\n\nAnd get this, even the media mob is helping China push their censorship agenda. Congressman Mike Waltz says, he has an ad, he's willing to get it paid for, NBC refused to air. This ad that he puts together along with NBA star Ennis Kanter Freedom. Take a look.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, POLITICAL AD)\n\n\n\nREP. MIKE WALTZ (R-FL): The world's greatest athletic showcase. Just outside of the show, rape, genocide, slave labor. American companies are drunk on Chinese dollars, entangled with communist dictators committing atrocities and propping up these genocide games staged by the Chinese communist party. And what can we do?\n\n\n\nENES KANTER FREEDOM, NBA STAR: Stand for freedom, defund the dictators. When you see \"made in China\" --\n\n\n\nWALTZ: Put it down.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nHANNITY: NBC get a double dose of coverage, run the ad. Pretty gutless.\n\n\n\nHere is Celtics player Enes Kanter Freedom, along with Republican Congressman Michael Waltz.\n\n\n\nCongressman, you're willing to pay for the ad. What was the reason they gave you that they wouldn't they take your money? Because that's not a common practice?\n\n\n\nWALTZ: You know, Sean, they said we're not rejecting it. We just want you to strip all those corporate logos and materially change it. So, it was kind of a non-rejection, rejection.\n\n\n\nAnd we're going to -- we're going to keep calling them out, all these woke corporations that want to preach social justice here at home, yet they turn a blind eye as the Chinese unleashed COVID on the world, massive military build up, threaten our supply chains, and commit these gross atrocities to millions of their own people.\n\n\n\nYou know, enough is enough. These American corporations are profiting it up. So, we're going to take the message directly to the American people.\n\n\n\nAnd as Enes said, you know, everybody wants to talk about defunding the police that's protecting our communities. Let's defund these communist dictatorships and the American people can vote with their wallet. When you see \"made in China\", put it down.\n\n\n\nHANNITY: Enes, it's interesting, the NBA does make a lot of money from China. They make an awful lot of money. Yet you decided to bravely take a stand.\n\n\n\nI don't know if there's going to be any retribution for taking that stand. Why did you take it?\n\n\n\nFREEDOM: Thanks for having me, Sean.\n\n\n\nI think -- you know, someone had to do it. You see, there are so many athletes, actors, you know, celebrities, or singers, or rappers, or people with platform are, you know, unfortunately, when it comes to China, they remain silent.\n\n\n\nSo, I feel like someone has to do it and talk about all the human rights abuses done by the Chinese communist party, and obviously, it does -- it takes a lot. But, you know, someone had to do it, and it's important to talk about human rights, not just in my home country Turkey, but all over the world.\n\n\n\nHANNITY: Yeah, I mean, it's pretty amazing.\n\n\n\nNow, if you take the advertising out of it -- so basically, NBC saying, we're not going to lose money. We'll overlook the genocide, we'll overlook the slave labor, the persecution of the Uyghur minority community, we'll overlook the territorial ambitions with Taiwan, we'll overlook the COVID lies -- we'll over look the crackdown in Hong Kong. As long as we get our money, we're okay with it. We'll take your money then.\n\n\n\nThat's what they're saying, Congressman?\n\n\n\nWALTZ: Yes, that's basically it, Sean. And the American people see right through all of this.\n\n\n\nI just got a call from someone in my district. They were at a diner in north Florida. One of the customers asked a waitress if they would turn on the Olympics and another one said, you know what, we don't support genocide in this establishment.\n\n\n\nAnd that's why you're seeing no one watch these games. People are tuning them off. And they're tuning them out, because they don't trust these corporate CEOs anymore than I do to actually have a spine and do the right thing.\n\n\n\nBut that's why made in America is the national security issue. It's a jobs issue and it's a basic human rights issue. And we are going to keep fighting this fight even despite the spineless media and corporate America.\n\n\n\nHANNITY: All right. I appreciate -- that ad needs to run.\n\n\n\nEnes, I also congratulate on everything in your personal life. I've read a lot about you. And thank you for taking the stand.\n\n\n\nWhen we come back, no limit on the left's COVID hypocrisy. Wait until you see what Stacey Abrams did before a bunch of school kids in masks. Tulsi Gabbard is next, straight ahead.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nHANNITY: All right. You had again far left Democrats caught in more blatant mask hypocrisy. This time, it's Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams who recently visited an elementary school outside of Atlanta sitting in a room with masked students while she was maskless and able to breathe freely, unlike all of those kids with masks on.\n\n\n\nAbrams responded in a statement saying in part, quote: It is shameful that our opponents are using a Black History Month reading event for Georgia children as the impetus for a false political attack.\n\n\n\nWhat's false about it? Anyway, no, Stacey Abrams, it's your hypocrisy. Did you notice or not notice every kid had a mask on? This is not the first time that a liberal politician is that wanted draconian measures that are hypocritical on all things COVID. Look at your screen, oh, remember Gavin Newsom? Yeah, caught there in that restaurant not socially distance, without a mask out, dining at the ritzy French laundry. How nice of him.\n\n\n\nAnd he did the same thing at NFC championship game. Remember that?\n\n\n\nAnd then my favorite of all is the failed L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti claiming he's not wearing a mask, L.A. has a mask made, and it was okay because he was holding his breath when the picture was being taken. OK.\n\n\n\nRemember Pelosi maskless? Remember? This is a great moment, because she was getting her hair done. I don't see a mask there either. And the list goes on and on.\n\n\n\nNow, some Democrats are seeing the writing on the wall, finally catching up to reality, as Democratic governors in California, New Jersey, Connecticut, Delaware, all announcing they are ending the mask mandates in schools. Hello, Mayor -- Governor Hochul.\n\n\n\nAnyway, here with the latest is Tulsi Gabbard is with us.\n\n\n\nWelcome back, Tulsi. I know you don't want them -- I know you didn't come prepared to ask a question tonight. But I came prepared to answer any question you have because I'm going to let you turn the tables on me anytime you want.\n\n\n\nTULSI GABBARD (D), FORMER U.S. CONGRESSWOMAN: All right.\n\n\n\nHANNITY: I think this is more than hypocrisy when you look at all of this. Why aren't they following the John Hopkins science? Nobody mentions it. Why aren't they following the science on therapeutics and the science on young people not having big problems with COVID?\n\n\n\nGABBARD: You're right, Sean. This is about something much bigger than the masks. This is really emblematic of this perverse relationship between the power elite and every day Americans. And you see it right there, you got Stacey Abrams sitting there in the front representing the power elite. They make the rules but don't follow them, or feel like they have to, and then you got these kids sitting behind her who represent us every day Americans who have to follow those rules or else face the consequences.\n\n\n\nSo, you got one set of rules for the power elite, a different set of rules for the rest us. One set of rules for the people like Hillary Clinton and Stacey Abrams and Gavin Newsom and those like them, and a different set of rules for the rest of us. You can talk to Nancy Pelosi about that. You've seen it with public gatherings. You've seen it with criminal justice reform.\n\n\n\nThere are so many different examples of this that really point to this deeply troubling and dangerous state of our nation, where we have the power elite who believe they are above the law, that the rules and laws they make don't apply to them. They apply to the rest of us.\n\n\n\nAnd you see how that is eroding. People's -- any semblance of faith and trust in fairness and justice and the laws that are being made in this country.\n\n\n\nHANNITY: Are you going to run for office again?\n\n\n\nGABBARD: I don't know.\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nHANNITY: All right. You just give me a list of 10 topics you're going to ask me that you might ask me about. You can pick one the next time you are back on. Maybe we'll even put on the fill-in list because I can't get Leo Terrell to fill in.\n\n\n\nGABBARD: All right.\n\n\n\nHANNITY: Tulsi, we love having you. Thank you for being with us.\n\n\n\nMore HANNITY coming up, straight ahead, right after this break.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nHANNITY: All right. Unfortunately, that is all the time we have for tonight. As always, we thank you for being here, because you are the ones that make the show possible. You give us this camera every night and we work hard to earn your viewership every night.\n\n\n\nLike I said, you have a choice. I can't make you watch. But I'm picking up ways to try. No, I'm kidding.\n\n\n\nAnyway, we hope you'll set your DVR so you never miss an episode. And I've got good news. In the meantime, let not your hearts be troubled, Laura Ingraham takes it away this Monday night.\n\n\n\nLaura, how are you?\n\n\n\nEND\n\n\n\nCopy: Content and Programming Copyright 2022 Fox News Network, LLC.

            "description": "Republicans won't let Democrats change Senate rules now, nor ever  Fox News",
            "content": "We are at a critical moment in history.\n\nWith the slimmest of majorities, Democrats haven’t been able to pass their wildly unpopular and dangerous agenda. As a result, they are considering using the nuclear option to eliminate the Senate’s 60-vote threshold for legislation. And, they are doing it under the guise of \"protecting voting rights.\"\n\nMake no mistake, this power grab is not about voting rights. Instead, it’s about advancing one party’s radical agenda.\n\nEven some of my fellow Senate colleagues on the opposite side agree that preserving the filibuster is in the best interest of the American people and in ensuring that the Senate continues to serve as the world’s greatest deliberative body. When speaking about whether she would support eliminating the filibuster, Democrat Senator Kyrsten Sinema said on the Senate floor last week that she would \"not support separate actions that worsen the underlying disease of division infecting our country.\"\n\nAnd my colleague from West Virginia, Senator Joe Manchin, followed up by saying, \"Allowing one party to exert complete control in the Senate with only a simple majority will only pour fuel onto the fire of political whiplash and dysfunction that is tearing this nation apart – especially when one party controls both Congress and the White House.\"\n\nI couldn’t agree more. Let’s also look back and see where other Democrats have stood on this issue in the past.\n\n\n\nAlso from my home state of West Virginia, the late Senator Robert Byrd—a longtime Democrat—was unequivocal in his defense of preserving the Senate’s rules. He wrote in 2010 that, \"the Senate has been the last fortress of minority rights and freedom of speech in this Republic for more than two centuries. I pray that Senators will pause and reflect before ignoring that history and tradition in favor of the political priority of the moment.\"\n\nDuring the previous administration, Senate Democrats used the filibuster more than 300 times. And in 2017, 32 Democrats joined Republicans—myself included—in a letter advocating to preserve the filibuster.\n\nIn 2005, President Biden said in a Senate speech, \"At its core, the filibuster is not about stopping a nominee or a bill – it's about compromise and moderation.\" In this same speech, he said when it came to eliminating the filibuster that, \"It is not only a bad idea, it upsets the constitutional design and it disservices the country.\"\n\n\n\nBut, he’s not the only one who has done a complete 180 when it comes to the filibuster. Majority Leader Schumer once said it would be \"doomsday for Democracy\" if the filibuster were to be eliminated. More recently, he called the filibuster \"the most important distinction between the Senate and the House.\"\n\nSo, what changed? Well, Democrats now can’t get their way, so they want to change the rules. If we change the rules to where only 50 votes are needed to pass legislation, there will be zero motivation for the two sides to work together.'\n\nJust as badly, legislative accomplishments could be undone and redone over and over with just one flip of a Senate seat.\n\nPolicies harmful to Americans across the country could be enacted immediately. Policies like the Green New Deal, court packing, federalizing our elections, packing the Senate with new states, defunding the police, attacking the Second Amendment for law-abiding Americans, and more.\n\nRamming radical policies through Congress without even attempting to gain consensus is not what the founders envisioned, and it’s not how Americans want us to operate.\n\n\n\nLast week, Leader Schumer pledged to hold these votes by early this week, a schedule that has now slid due to opposition within his own party. But, even in the face of that opposition, he says he will bring them up anyhow, further sowing division among the Senate and the country.\n\nAfter the president’s speech in Georgia likening honest differences in opinion to segregationist politicians of the past, and Leader Schumer’s full steam ahead toward socialism, I and my Republican colleagues will continue to stand firm for what is right for America, including its bedrock institutions like the United States Senate.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nRest assured, those willing to change the rules to benefit themselves will do it again and again and again. Today, it’s supposedly about \"voting rights.\" Tomorrow, it will be about gun control. And the next day, it will be about open borders.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe last time Democrats changed the rules to benefit themselves in the short term, Leader McConnell rightly predicted they would regret it. This time, with much more on the line, will Democrats regret doing it again? You bet they will.\n\nBut, unfortunately, the country will suffer the consequences.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY SHELLEY MOORE CAPITO",

            "content": "When I visited Kyiv in September, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was a worried man. No one seemed to care, he told a gathering of European officials and foreign policy experts, that Russia had invaded Ukraine’s Crimea in 2014 and occupied it for eight years.\n\nHis Western allies seemed insufficiently alarmed by the 100,000 Russian troops on his border and Moscow’s constant provocations aimed at destabilizing his government and sparking civil unrest. Few outsiders mourned the more than 13,200 Ukrainians who had already died fighting Russian-backed separatist forces in the eastern region of Donbas or the two million who had been displaced by the low-intensity war, a conflict that even then was claiming a Ukrainian soldier’s life every three days.\n\nPENTAGON: RUSSIA BUILDUP ON UKRAINE BORDER IS LARGEST SINCE COLD WAR, CONFLICT WOULD BE ‘HORRIFIC’\n\nThe West’s seeming indifference to the specter of an escalating full-blown conflict on the European continent for the first time since the Cold War, he complained, left him feeling politically isolated and Ukraine increasingly vulnerable. When it came to battling Russia or the deadliest global pandemic in modern times, the gap between the West's rhetorical support for his country and its actions led him to conclude that Ukraine was on its own. In such crises, he lamented, \"it's every man for himself.\"\n\nHowever belated, the U.S. has finally made it clear that Zelenskyy is not on his own. While President Joe Biden has repeatedly ruled out a military response by the U.S or its NATO allies should Russia invade Ukraine again, he has warned Russian President Vladimir Putin that further military aggression will result in what he recently called \"massive consequences and severe economic costs.\" Paradoxically, some of Biden’s toughest measures to date – i.e., the actual delivery on Saturday of long-promised weapons to Kyiv and the threat to possibly deploy some 8,500 U.S. forces to bolster front-line Russian NATO members – came after Biden stumbled badly by saying that a \"minor\" Russian incursion into Ukraine might not trigger a painful economic and diplomatic response.\n\nAnd paradoxically, Biden’s blunder may inadvertently have toughened America’s policy. \"Of course, talking about possibly sending additional troops to Eastern Europe is not the same as actually sending them,\" said John Herbst, a veteran diplomat, former ambassador to Ukraine, and current senior director of the Atlantic Council's Eurasia Center. \"But it may be significant enough to do the job.\"\n\nAlthough Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said Wednesday there was \"every indication\" that Putin was preparing to use more force against Ukraine – though not during the upcoming Winter Olympics in Beijing in February, which he is planning to attend and which would embarrass his rival/ally China – Herbst said he believes that Putin may ultimately decide not to do so. While Putin has repeatedly argued that Ukraine is linguistically, culturally, and historically an integral part of \"Russia’s world\" and that Russian national security is threatened by Ukraine’s desire to join the European Union and NATO – neither of which is likely to happen any time soon – Herbst argues that Putin probably knows how risky such a course might be.\n\nFor one thing, as Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dimitri Kuleba said this week, if one of Putin’s major foreign policy goals is getting NATO forces to withdraw from Eastern Europe, a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine would only \"accelerate what he fears.\" Second, Herbst and others argue, Putin knows that apart from its nuclear prowess, Russia is economically weak and that sanctions could further depress his economy and intensify political pressures on his regime whose popularity is dropping.\n\nRussia is already suffering economically from the threatened economic sanctions. As the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday, Russian stocks fell eight percent this week and the ruble dropped to a 14-month low. JPMorgan Chase bank has already stopped handling the ruble and closed all its positions in Russian currency, saying the possibility of war makes trading in rubles too risky.\n\nEven if Washington cannot persuade Germany to cancel the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline that will deliver to Germans Russian natural gas, by-passing Ukraine, and fails to persuade other European allies to expel Russia from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), which facilitates international money transfers, the U.S. could increase financial pressure on Russia by sanctioning companies and countries that buy Russian debt.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nBut perhaps one of the most potent deterrents may be Ukrainians themselves. Although Ukrainian forces are no match for the Russian army, \"this is not the Ukraine of years ago,\" Wendy Sherman warned Putin in her remarks to a forum sponsored by the Kyiv-based Yalta European Strategy (YES). \"This is a country that will stand up for itself. Russia needs to know,\" she warned, that an invasion \"will cost Russian lives.\" While that may matter little to a brutal autocrat like Putin, video on TV and social media of Ukrainians fighting and killing Russians is likely to undermine his argument that Russians and Ukrainians are \"brothers\" and that Russophobia is the handiwork of U.S. and NATO plotting.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIndeed, Moscow’s seizure of Crimea and the ongoing war in the Donbas have sparked a sea change in Ukrainian attitudes toward Mother Russia. Whereas young Ukrainians once spoke to one another in Russian, Ukrainian is increasingly their language of choice. Whereas pro-Russian political parties once won presidential elections and formed majorities in parliament, they now struggle to secure the 20 percent required for participation. Although Russia has been conducting intensive destabilization operations in Ukraine for eight years, it boasts few successes. If anything, loyalty to Ukraine, especially among young Ukrainians, who lack their grandparents’ nostalgia for Soviet rule, has been reinforced by Putin’s autocratic rule at home and his aggression towards them and other former Soviet republics abroad. Though it might pain him to acknowledge it, said Herbst, \"Putin is the father of Ukrainian nationalism.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JUDITH MILLER",

            "description": "Outsized personalities often are the ones who deliver results in politics. Across the aisle, there are several making large splashes with their actions.",
            "content": "For all the cold calculations of politics, for all the partisan loyalties and vote-trading and brand management, it often comes down to outsized personalities.\n\nWhether heroic or stubborn, whether principled or reckless, politicians at the highest level sometimes feed their considerable egos by going rogue.\n\nWhat, for instance, is Nancy Pelosi doing visiting Taiwan, which has now essentially been confirmed for Wednesday? She has defied the president of her own party – which makes Joe Biden look weak – and triggered what could be a military confrontation.\n\nEven granting that the House speaker is a longtime defender of Taiwan, what will this confrontational tactic accomplish other than putting her at the center of the global stage?\n\nWe already have Beijing, which views Taiwan as a breakaway province, saying it will treat Pelosi’s attempt to land in a military jet as an invasion that must be repelled. The Chinese communists are moving to stage military exercises opposite Taiwan. It is nothing short of a major diplomatic confrontation, all for a symbolic visit that accomplishes nothing. But there is something in Pelosi’s personality that is compelling her to shrug off the criticism, despite some praise on the right, and seek a dramatic landing to meet the island’s president in Taipei.\n\nThe same could be said of Joe Manchin, the conservative Democrat who has been vilified for months for refusing to budge on Biden’s $3.5-trillion Build Back Better plan or to wave the filibuster to get some version of it through. You’ve got to have a thick hide to resist that kind of pressure from your president and your party to single-handedly block the agenda that your people insist was transformational.\n\nSINEMA STILL UNDECIDED ON MANCHIN SOCIAL SPENDING BILL, WILL MAKE DETERMINATION AFTER PARLIAMENTARIAN REVIEW\n\nThe West Virginia senator said no so many times that journalists and everyone else gave up. But Manchin knows his leverage as deputy president vanishes on Election Day, when he turns into a pumpkin, as wanted to be remembered for a sweeping compromise. So, with a personality that has driven everyone nuts, he greenlighted a $700-billion bill on climate change, raising corporate taxes and supposedly reducing inflation.\n\nBut there is another Democrat with a contrarian personality who drives her party to distraction, and that’s Kyrsten Sinema. She has clung to the filibuster even though it decimated any chance of codifying Roe v. Wade. The Arizona senator is the one person who could blow up the Manchin deal, and she is stretching out the drama while signaling concerns about one corporate loophole.\n\nSinema also knows her superpower vanishes in November – does she have the guts to gut the bill that Biden is already celebrating as a victory?\n\nAnother obvious candidate for overpowering personality is Donald Trump. Throughout his presidency, advisers and confidantes would tell him you can’t do that: Meet with Kim Jong Un with no deal, fire Cabinet members by tweet, buy Greenland, call media outlets the enemy of the people. And he would keep on doing it.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF ON THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES\n\nBut that same pugnacious approach has not always served him well. In refusing to accept the 2020 election results, in refusing to intervene in the Capitol riot for 187 minutes, in continuing to pound away at an unproven \"stolen election,\" Trump is disregarding the urging of his former aides and current inner circle. At the same time, he has convinced a significant number of Republicans that Biden is an illegitimate president, and his base loves his fighting spirit, even when the facts show he is wrong.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nYou could even say that Joe Biden’s low-key personality – rooted in a simpler, slower time when bipartisan cooperation was not considered a sin – makes him the only president who would have had the patience to ultimately get a deal with Manchin. The president doesn’t push back much, is dishwater dull on Twitter, but it’s hard to imagine Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders achieving this outcome – if in fact Sinema doesn’t pull the plug.\n\nOn paper, politics often seems simple and straightforward. But it is the powerhouse personalities – who are convinced of their own self-righteousness – that for better or worse change history.",

But Manchin knows his leverage as deputy president vanishes on Election Day, when he turns into a pumpkin, as wanted to be remembered for a sweeping compromise. The Arizona senator is the one person who could blow up the Manchin deal, and she is stretching out the drama while signaling concerns about one corporate loophole.\n\nSinema also knows her superpower vanishes in November – does she have the guts to gut the bill that Biden is already celebrating as a victory? In refusing to accept the 2020 election results, in refusing to intervene in the Capitol riot for 187 minutes, in continuing to pound away at an unproven \"stolen election,\" Trump is disregarding the urging of his former aides and current inner circle.",

            "content": "The Pittsburgh Steelers have lost three games in a row, including a Week 4 loss to the New York Jets during which the Steelers lost a 10-point fourth-quarter lead.\n\nThe losing streak has led to a quarterback change with 2022 first-round NFL Draft pick Kenny Pickett getting the start in on the road.\n\nPickett, who replaced starting quarterback Mitch Trubisky at halftime Sunday, is now listed as QB1 on Pittsburgh’s depth chart.\n\n\"I don't want to dump the responsibility of what transpired at Mitch's feet,\" head coach Mike Tomlin said at his Tuesday press conference, according to ESPN. \"That's not fair to him. He's played better than that description, but we haven't. And so, in an effort to be better, in an effort to score more points, in an effort to move the ball more fluidly, we decided to go to Kenny in the hope that he would provide a spark for us. We felt that, not only in terms of our ability to move the ball but just in terms of energy.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\n\"And so, hopefully, that's a catalyst for us as we try to move forward and change the outcome of some of these games.\"\n\nPickett provided a in his one half of play against New York, scoring the Steelers' only two touchdowns of the game on the ground in a 24-20 loss.\n\nPickett’s first start will be a tough road game against the 3-1 Bills and a defense allowing the fewest passing yards per game. The Bills have surrendered three touchdowns through the air while collecting seven interceptions.\n\nCOWBOYS OWNER JERRY JONES SAYS DAK PRESCOTT PROGRESSING, STILL CAN’T GRIP BALL ‘WELL ENOUGH TO PLAY’\n\nAgainst the Jets, Pickett threw three interceptions on 10-for-13 passing for 120 yards, though one of his interceptions was on a last-second Hail Mary.\n\n\"We have no reservations about what Kenny is going to be capable of in terms of schematics,\" Tomlin said. \"Obviously, we have a level of concern about the environment we're taking them into, but you have a level of concern about any quarterback that you take to that environment versus that defense and that venue.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Kenny has shown us maturity at every point throughout this process. He's older than most rookies, and that was obviously discussed leading up to the draft process, the things that we valued in him from a draft perspective – fluid and quick decision-making, pro-like anticipation and things of that nature have proven to be true. That’s why we took him when we had the opportunity to do so.\"",

            "description": "In an altered reality, Democrats cry foul as Republicans change the rules, because Washington is nothing more than a hall of mirrors, these days.",
            "content": "Washington is a hall of mirrors, these days.\n\nWhat Republicans see as accountability in government is viewed by Democrats as harassing federal officials for doing their job.\n\nWhat Republicans see as protecting the little guy from wild-eyed tax auditors is seen by Democrats as allowing fat cats to get away with tax fraud.\n\nWhile many Republicans want newly elected serial fabricator George Santos to resign, he said yesterday he is not and the House leadership is not pressing the issue.\n\nWILL BLOWING OFF THE MEDIA BE THE NEXT BIG THING FOR 2024 REPUBLICANS?\n\nAnd what Republicans view as hypocritical misconduct by Joe Biden on classified documents, Democrats see as model behavior that contrasts with blatant lawbreaking by Donald Trump.\n\nNo wonder nobody knows which way is up. In Kevin McCarthy’s Washington, each side is staring at a polar-opposite reality.\n\nAnd the media long ago lost their ability to play the role of honest referee.\n\nIn each instance, this is not the usual partisan wrangling to gain the upper hand. These are deep-seated beliefs about the essence of what government should do or refrain from doing.\n\nAs part of the negotiations that made him speaker, McCarthy agreed to create a Judiciary subcommittee on the weaponization of the federal government. Democrats dismiss this as investigating the investigators – going back over legitimate probes to discredit the job done by the FBI and other law-enforcement agencies.\n\nJim Jordan, who will run Judiciary, said he was not trying to undermine past Trump investigations but to protect the First Amendment and keep conservatives from being unfairly targeted. \"We don’t want to go after anyone. We just want it to stop,\" he said.\n\nBut the subcommittee, denounced by Democrats, could become the main vehicle for investigations of the Biden administration. And its insistence on having access to classified information, even involving ongoing Justice Department probes, is likely to create a showdown over how far such a panel can go without jeopardizing legitimate investigations.\n\nWHY MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE, WHO HELPED MCCARTHY BECOME SPEAKER, TRIED INSIDE GAME\n\nThe IRS is another battleground where no one can agree on the terms of engagement. A series of fact-checkers, including in the Washington Post, say it’s bogus for Republicans to say they’re going to get rid of 87,000 IRS agents who will make life miserable for working families and small businesses.\n\nMost of those hired under past Biden legislation will not be agents, the overall size of the agency will continue to shrink and no one earning less than $400,000 a year will be audited, the truth-squadders say. In fact, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says if the GOP has its way, the budget deficit will rise by $115 billion because the wealthy will get away with tax chicanery.\n\nNonsense, say the Republicans, who are trading on the agency’s unpopularity – who wants to be audited? – by insisting they will protect hard-working wage slaves from overzealous auditors. (Reality check: This is all Kabuki theater, because whatever bills the House passes, they will be blocked by the Democratic Senate or by President Biden’s veto.)\n\nGeorge Santos, who has fictionalized everything from his college (he never attended) and Wall Street background (non-existent) to his religion (which isn’t Jewish), told a scrum of reporters yesterday he will not quit. \"I was elected to serve the people of #NY03 not the party & politicians,\" Santos tweeted.\n\nThe Republican Party of Long Island’s Nassau County is demanding his resignation, and Santos faces multiple investigations, but at the moment no one can force him out. Several Democrats told McCarthy in a letter that Santos poses a \"direct threat to national security,\" but the speaker told reporters that the voters made the decision to elect him and as of now he would give him committee assignments.\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN HAS BEEN 'IGNORING' THE BORDER CRISIS EVEN AS IT WORSENS\n\n\"He’s going to have to build the trust here,\" the speaker said.\n\nBut no spin cycle is more dizzying than the one involving classified documents.\n\nThe media have rushed to point out that what Joe Biden did is exactly what Trump should have done. Once Biden’s people discovered that 10 classified documents had made their way to the University of Pennsylvania’s Biden center, they notified the National Archives, voluntarily turned over the stuff and are cooperating.\n\nAnd what a contrast, say Biden’s liberal allies, with a former president whose far greater number of classified papers had to be subpoenaed, and even after the Trump team said he’d returned everything, that FBI raid found another 100 classified documents at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nWell, fine. But what Biden did totally muddies the waters. And after listening to endless self-righteous speeches about the dangers of keeping top-secret material, you can’t blame Trump and his supporters for exulting in the fact that Biden, upon leaving office as VP, didn’t follow the rules.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF ON THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES\n\nWhat’s more, the Biden Penn Center got a major surge in donations from China after the former vice president set it up – while Hunter Biden was engaging in global buckraking. And the timing – the papers were discovered six days before the midterms, but not disclosed until now – feels like an effort to hide something.\n\nAnd late yesterday, NBC reported that Biden aides discovered at least one more batch of classified documents in a location separate from the Penn Washington office…drip drip drip.\n\nIt’s just hard to grasp how Merrick Garland can now prosecute Trump on anything related to the documents if his own boss gets a pass. It just doesn’t smell right. Even with Trump throwing out unsubstantiated allegations about the \"Biden crime family,\" even with the AG handing the matter to a Trump-appointed prosecutor, it will smell like a double standard.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThat’s why, when you strip away the factual finger-pointing, Biden just gave Trump an enormous political gift.",

            "content": "Two United States Football League teams made changes to their coaching staffs with the start of the 2023 season about two months away.\n\nThe Michigan Panthers hired Mike Nolan back on Feb. 3 to replace Jeff Fisher. On Wednesday, the Houston Gamblers hired Curtis Johnson to replace Kevin Sumlin. The former Texas A&M head coach ended up taking an assistant role at Maryland.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nNolan was the head coach for the San Francisco 49ers from 2005 to 2008 and was 18-37 in that span. He never had a winning record. The 49ers drafted Alex Smith over Aaron Rodgers during his tenure. He served in various other coaching positions around the NFL after the 49ers fired him in the middle of the 2008 season. He was last the Dallas Cowboys’ defensive coordinator in 2020.\n\n\"I am very excited to join the USFL and the Michigan Panthers. Playing great football and competing at a high level is what the Panthers are going to be about,\" Nolan said in a news release. \"It will take a loud and rabid fanbase to help us get there. I’ve experienced the passionate fans of Michigan and Detroit while coaching against the Lions, and I was always impressed. Our goal with the Panthers is to play with energy and pride for the entire state we represent. I want our fans to be proud to root for the Panthers.\"\n\n2 USFL TEAMS TO PLAY REGULAR-SEASON GAMES NEAR PRO FOOTBALL HALL OF FAME\n\nJohnson’s foray into the United States Football League after having coached Tulane from 2013 to 2015. He was 13-24 with the Green Wave in that span. Tulane was 7-6 in his first season in 2013 but lost in the New Orleans Bowl. Johnson was an assistant coach on the New Orleans Saints when they captured their first Super Bowl title over the Indianapolis Colts.\n\n\"This is a tremendous opportunity to serve Houston, their fans, and our players. I want to make the city of Houston proud about our team and the USFL,\" Johnson said in a separate news release. \"As a former wide receivers coach, I’m going to bring a brand of football that is exciting and fast by airing it out while also running the ball. On defense, the Gamblers will always be focused on being physical and creating turnovers. I’m excited to get to work building a winner for Houston football fans.\"\n\nThe Panthers finished 2-8 last season and the Gamblers were 3-7.\n\nBoth teams are set to play in different facilities in 2023. Michigan will play Ford Field with the Philadelphia Stars, and the Gamblers will play at Simmons Bank Liberty Stadium with the Memphis Showboats.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe two teams meet in Week 1 on April 16 at noon ET.",

            "content": "For the second time in his NFL career, Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Robbie Anderson appears to have changed his name.\n\nWith the New York Jets, it was Robby Anderson. He simply changed the end prior to last season when he began the year with the Carolina Panthers, saying it was how he used to spell it when he was younger.\n\nBut Anderson has appeared to completely change his first name, and he’s done so legally as he showed on Instagram.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nAnderson’s first name is now \"Chosen.\"\n\nAnderson showed a group of texts that he got confirming his desire to change his first name.\n\n\"Great news! Our motion for reconsideration worked! Name changes granted an official!\" the text to Anderson read.\n\nJJ WATT CLAPS BACK AT CRITIC WHO SAYS HE ‘CAN’T PLAY ANYMORE'\n\n\"WITH GOD 1st Stay Righteous Heart Pure & Genuine I Will Always Prevail Stay Wise And Focused On My Purpose,\" Anderson captioned his reveal post.\n\nMore information may come on why Anderson decided to choose \"Chosen\" as his new first name, but he certainly isn’t the first NFL player to do so.\n\nFormer NFL wide receiver Chad Johnson famously changed his name to Chad Javon Ochocinco on Aug. 29, 2008. However, he went back to Johnson in 2012 when he joined the Miami Dolphins.\n\nAnderson is set to enter his first full season with the Cardinals, though some speculate that Jonathan Gannon’s introduction as the team’s new head coach could lead to some roster changes that make Anderson a free agent.\n\nWhen he joined the Cardinals last year, he played a depth role behind players like DeAndre Hopkins, Marquise Brown, Greg Dortch and more. He had just seven catches for 76 yards in 10 games after totaling 206 yards and one touchdown with the struggling Panthers in six games.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAnderson has one year left on his contract with the Cardinals before becoming an unrestricted free agent.",

He is set to enter his first full season with the Cardinals, though some speculate that Jonathan Gannon's introduction as the team’s new head coach could lead to some roster changes that make Anderson a free agent.

It wasn’t immediately known if he has been offered a deal with a lesser charge.\n\nMICHIGAN GOV. WHITMER KIDNAPPING PLOT: CO-LEADER BARRY CROFT JR. SENTENCED TO MORE THAN 19 YEARS IN PRISON\n\nHiggins' attorney declined to comment Tuesday. The attorney general's office acknowledged only that a hearing was scheduled.\n\nA plea of guilty or no contest would be a big victory for state prosecutors. Three men in a separate but related trial were found guilty in Jackson County in October and are serving long prison terms.\n\nThe main Whitmer kidnapping conspiracy was charged in federal court in Grand Rapids.

WHITMER\n\nHiggins trained with members of the conspiracy at a \"kill house\" in a remote hunting area, according to evidence. On that same weekend, in September 2020, he drove with others to scout Whitmer's vacation home in Elk Rapids. She wasn't there at the time.\n\nDespite some confusion over the address, \"Higgins drove by the governor’s residence and recorded it on the dashcam of his vehicle,\" prosecutors said in a court filing.\n\n\"Higgins noted that he had seen some apartments nearby the governor’s residence and suggested that they could rent some of them as a safehouse of sorts,\" prosecutors said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nInformants and undercover FBI agents were inside the group, recording conversations and gathering evidence.

            "description": "Nebraska legislators are embroiled in a heated debate over the future of legislation aiming to ban hormone-altering treatments and sex change procedures for minors.",
            "content": "Debate that began Tuesday on a Nebraska bill to ban gender-affirming care for minors, which led one lawmaker to stage an epic weekslong filibuster, quickly grew contentious, with supporters and opponents angrily voicing their frustration and admonishing each other for a lack of collegiality.\n\nSen. John Lowe, of Kearney, cited an activist group's claim that gender dysphoria in youth \"is just temporary,\" while Sen. Brad von Gillern, of Omaha, compared gender-affirming treatment to shock treatments, lobotomies and forced sterilizations of years' past. Bellevue Sen. Carol Blood countered that if lawmakers really cared about medical procedures affecting children, \"how come we're not talking about circumcision?\"\n\nAnd that was only the first three hours of an eight-hour Senate debate expected to stretch into Thursday.\n\nThe bill introduced by Republican Sen. Kathleen Kauth, a freshman lawmaker in the officially-nonpartisan state Legislature, would outlaw gender-affirming therapies such as hormone treatments, puberty blockers and gender reassignment surgery for those 18 and younger.\n\nThe proposal had already caused tumult in the legislative session, cited as the genesis of a nearly three-week filibuster carried out by Omaha Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh over her opposition. Cavanaugh had followed through on her vow in late February to filibuster every bill before the Legislature — even those she supported — declaring she would \"burn the session to the ground over this bill.\"\n\nShe stuck with it until an agreement was reached late last week to push the bill to the front of the debate queue. Instead of trying to eat time to keep the bill from getting to the floor, Cavanaugh decided she wanted a vote to put on the record of which lawmakers would \"legislate hate against children.\"\n\nLawmakers convened Tuesday to begin that debate with the understanding that the bill didn't have enough votes to break a filibuster. But Kauth introduced an amendment to drop the restriction on hormone treatments, instead banning only gender reassignment surgery for minors. That amendment, she said, does have enough votes to advance.\n\nCavanaugh has said if the bill advances on a vote expected Thursday, she will resume filibustering every bill through the end of the 90-day session in early June.\n\nThe hard feelings by lawmakers on both sides of the bill emerged almost immediately Tuesday, with Kauth calling Cavanaugh’s filibuster \"self-serving and childish.\" Kauth said the purpose of her bill is to protect youth from undertaking gender-affirming treatments they might later regret as adults, citing research that says adolescents' brains aren't fully developed.\n\nOmaha Sen. Megan Hunt called out that argument as hypocritical, noting that Kauth supports an abortion ban bill introduced this session that would also affect adolescents.\n\n\"In a couple of weeks, she's going to turn around and vote for a bill that would force 12-year-olds to have a baby,\" Hunt said. \"She thinks they're mature enough for that.\"\n\nNEBRASKA SCHOOL BOARD MOVING FORWARD WITH POLICY FOR TRANS ATHLETES DESPITE OPPOSITION: ‘UNFAIR PLAYING FIELD’\n\nCavanaugh called the trans treatment bill \"an assault on individuals that members of this body love,\" and appealed to Republican members of the body to get back to their core principles of getting government out of people’s lives.\n\n\"So many of you have talked to me about government overreach time and time again,\" she said. \"This bill stands in opposition to the tenets that many of you have expressed to me are the foundation of why you are here.\"\n\nThe Nebraska bill, along with another that would ban trans people from using bathrooms and locker rooms or playing on sports teams that don’t align with the gender listed on their birth certificates, are among roughly 150 bills targeting transgender people that have been introduced in state legislatures this year.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBans on gender-affirming care for minors have already been enacted this year in some Republican-led states, including South Dakota, Utah and Mississippi. Arkansas and Alabama have bans that were temporarily blocked by federal judges. Other states legislatures have given final approval to measures similar to the Nebraska bill, with Georgia sending to the governor Tuesday a bill that would ban most gender-affirming surgeries and hormone replacement therapies for transgender minors.",

The bill, introduced by Republican Sen. Kathleen Kauth, would outlaw gender-Affirming therapies such as hormone treatments, puberty blockers and gender reassignment surgery for those 18 and younger, would also ban trans people from using bathrooms and locker rooms or playing on sports teams that don't align with the gender listed on their birth certificates. Supporters and opponents of the bill have voiced their frustration and admonished each other for a lack of collegiality. If the bill advances, Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh will resume filibustering every bill through the end of the 90-day session in early June. Other states have also passed similar measures this year, with federal judges given final approval to the Nebraska bill that would ban most transgender minors.",

            "description": "New York Times writer accuses investment firm BlackRock of climate 'hypocrisy'",
            "content": "New York Times writer David Wallace-Well penned an op-ed Thursday that accused the world's largest asset manager BlackRock and other corporations of \"hypocrisy\" on climate change. The article, titled \"What’s Worse: Climate Denial or Climate Hypocrisy?\", contends that many companies that pledged to invest in more climate friendly initiatives have not fulfilled their promises.\n\n\"The era of climate denial has been replaced with one plagued by climate promises that no one seems prepared to keep,\" he wrote.\n\nWallace-Wells pointed to an annual letter published by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink as evidence for his claim. He noted that Fink \"called global warming the most serious threat to the financial system in his 40 years of experience and promised a drastic response from his firm.\"\n\nGOP SENATORS PRESS BIDEN ADMIN ON ENFORCEMENT OF TRUMP PRESIDENTIAL ORDER ON TIKTOK\n\nWallace-Wells wrote that Fink’s promises included \"making sustainability ‘integral to portfolio construction and risk management’, ditching investments that contribute to the problem; and pursuing not just sustainability but transparency, too, so we all could see what impacts the company was having.\"\n\nHe asserted that \" finance seemed to take the hint , creating a new wave of purportedly virtuous ‘environmental, social and governance’ (E.S.G.) investing.\"\n\nDespite these promises, Fink has recently struck a radically different tone, according to Wallace-Wells.\n\n\"But in his annual letter this January, just two years later, Fink struck a radically different tone, rejecting ‘woke’ capitalism and elevating the principle that investors should center only on profits,\" he wrote. \"In the spring, the firm announced it would support fewer shareholder resolutions on climate change, ‘as we do not consider them to be consistent with our clients’ long-term financial interests.’ Just months before, BlackRock closed a $15.5 billion investment in Saudi pipelines.\"\n\nLA TIMES SUGGESTS A RECESSION ‘MAY NOT BE THAT BAD’ AFTER COLUMNS DOWNPLAYED INFLATION CONCERNS\n\n\"What should we call an about-face like this? The word that comes most easily to mind is ‘hypocrisy’ — or perhaps ‘greenwashing,’ the insult that activists like to lob at companies that use eco-friendly rhetoric to launder their reputations,\" he added. \"This basic phenomenon, in which powerful people make climate pledges that turn out to wildly outrace their genuine commitments, has now become so pervasive that it begins to look less like venality by any one person or institution and more like a new political grammar.\"\n\nCritics of ESG argue that it is a mechanism used by the government and private sector to force a transition away from oil and fossil fuels, as well as pushing diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives at the expense of fiduciary duty.\n\n\"Environmental, social, governance. The acronym ESG is a classification and rating system that globalists are now using to pressure American companies into adopting progressive practices at every level of their operations. And like so many really bad ideas, it, of course, originated at the United Nations,\" Ingraham said. \"Now for years, they've aggressively marketed the concept as good for companies, good for you and good for the planet. ESG propaganda even comes in the form of really creepy videos.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSimilarly, New York University Professor of Finance Aswath Damodaran argued against ESG.\n\n\"They act like they are the Dalai Lama and Mother Teresa wrapped up in one, that they can identify what is virtuous,\"he . \"But there is no global consensus for what is good and virtuous,\" he continued.\n\nBlackRock has been criticized for promoting a globalist Left wing agenda in America while investing heavily in authoritarian and oppressive China.",

The article, titled \"What’s Worse: Climate Denial or Climate Hypocrisy?\", contends that many companies that pledged to invest in more climate friendly initiatives have not fulfilled their promises. \n\n\"The era of climate denial has been replaced with one plagued by climate promises that no one seems prepared to keep,\" he wrote. \"In the spring, the firm announced it would support fewer shareholder resolutions on climate change, ‘as we do not consider them to be consistent with our clients’ long-term financial interests.’",

            "content": "President Biden’s capitulation to the Left on green energy \"created the perfect storm\" for Russia’s Vladimir Putin to invade Ukraine, Republicans say.\n\nGreen groups are celebrating the president’s comments last week that clean energy is the answer to ending the country’s reliance on foreign oil after he banned imports of Russian oil and gas in an effort to weaken Putin.\n\nBIDEN ‘DOES NOT CARE’ ABOUT SMALL-TOWN AMERICA, SOUTH DAKOTANS SAY: ‘IF HE DID CARE, KEYSTONE WOULD BE GOING’\n\nBiden said Russia’s war against Ukraine and its effects on global oil markets \"should motivate us to accelerate a transition to clean energy.\"\n\nBut while progressive groups like the Sunrise Movement have looked at the current crisis as an opportunity to move towards ending America’s reliance on fossil fuels, Republicans say it’s those very same policies that created the crisis in the first place.\n\n\"The world cannot rely solely on renewable energy like wind and solar at this point and time – that’s a fact the White House can’t understand,\" Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., who serves on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, told Fox News Digital. \"It's clear that the US could have easily provided an alternative to Russian energy to our allies and taken away the Kremlin’s ‘ace’ had this administration not bent to the whims of the progressive Left and deserted an effective all-of-the-above energy strategy.\"\n\n\"There is no denying that abandoning traditional fuel sources and failing to export LNG to our allies, per the Left’s climate agenda, created the perfect storm for Putin to take advantage of,\" he added.\n\nSenate Minority Whip John Thune, R-S.D., said the Democrats’ push for electric vehicles during the energy crisis is over-simplistic.\n\n\"I’m not opposed to clean energy, but the real solution to America’s energy independence is right under our feet, if we’re willing to look,\" Thune told Fox News Digital. \"We need a federal government that understands the importance of responsible domestic oil and gas development as the foundation of an all-of-the-above energy strategy – a strategy that also includes biofuels, nuclear, and renewables.\"\n\n\"America can once again achieve energy independence, and we must,\" he said. \"As we’re seeing here and around the globe, energy security is also a matter of national security.\"\n\nRepublicans argue that Biden’s axing of the Keystone XL pipeline and pausing of new federal oil drilling prevented America from remaining energy independent. Lawmakers in Biden's own party also criticized him in May after he lifted sanctions on the company behind Russia’s Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.\n\nCritics say the country's continued reliance on foreign adversaries like Russia for oil and gas imports gave Putin more leverage in his calculus to invade Ukraine.\n\nHouse Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., who also sits on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, wrote in a piece for Fox News Digital on Monday that Biden \"has played into Putin’s hands by ending American energy independence and renouncing U.S. oil and gas resources.\"\n\n\"Europe did not become energy-dependent on Russia overnight. Putin’s barbaric attacks on Ukraine can be traced to Europe’s scorn for fossil fuels and nuclear power,\" Scalise wrote. \"Through his efforts to make the United States more like Europe, President Biden has ensured that European countries cannot turn to our abundant resources to drive down natural gas prices and cut free from Russian energy.\"\n\n\"While the U.S. could meet all of Europe’s energy needs, Europe receives nearly 40% of its natural gas from Russia,\" he continued. \"Without alternative energy suppliers, European families will suffer from over-reliance on Russia because of European leaders’ shortsighted Green New Deal policies.\"\n\n\"President Biden’s disastrous leadership has crippled the United States’ power and influence on the world stage,\" he added. \"Sadly, we are seeing now how the Biden administration’s far-left energy policies have made Russia richer and emboldened Vladimir Putin.\"\n\nSen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., made similar statements in a recent piece for Fox News Digital, arguing that \"simultaneously blocking the U.S. pipeline and green-lighting Russia’s pipeline sent the message that American security would be sacrificed in order to appease European leaders and environmental extremists.\"\n\n\"The final sticking point is Nord Stream 2,\" Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., ranking member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, told Fox News in January. \"Germany saying they’re delaying the approval of the pipeline for the next six months. I want to permanently stop that pipeline. You know that Vladimir Putin very effectively uses energy as a weapon. He uses it against other countries. He uses it to fund his military.\"\n\n\"And Joe Biden has played right into his hands by killing the Keystone XL pipeline in this country and making it harder for us to use the energy we have in America right now,\" he said.\n\nBiden dragged his feet on announcing a ban on Russian oil and gas imports on March 8 after facing pressure from his own party. Gas prices were already smashing records and bringing down his approval ratings well before Russian forces attacked Ukraine, but the war accelerated the rise.\n\nThe Biden administration had previously released 50 million barrels of oil from the National Strategic Reserve on Nov. 23, 2021, in an attempt to alleviate growing pain at the pump. The administration released another 30 million barrels from the reserve this month, but the prices continued to rise. After he announced a ban on Russian oil, Biden warned Americans that there was \"not much\" he could do about the rising prices.\n\nOn Friday, Biden told House Democrats that the record gas prices and inflation, which hit a 40-year high last month, are not his fault.\n\n\"Make no mistake, inflation’s largely the fault of Putin,\" he said. \"I love, you know, the Republicans saying it’s Biden’s gas pipeline, Biden’s said he’s going to stop the Keystone Pipeline and I did and that’s the reason prices went up. Folks let’s get something straight here, the Keystone Pipeline was two years away and had been 2 percent finished. Give me a break.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Biden declared war on U.S. energy production,\" Cruz told Fox News on Friday. \"He shut down the Keystone pipeline, he shut down leases on federal lands, he shut down ANWR. And the result is rig counts plummeted, and when you reduce supply, when you reduce U.S. production, price goes up.\"",

            "title": "Biden immigration decision could make midterm climate even tougher for Democrats",
            "description": "Republicans see the Biden administration's rescinding of Trump-era pandemic restrictions along the U.S.-Mexico border as fresh ammunition to use in the midterm elections",
            "content": "Minutes after President Biden’s administration rescinded Trump-era pandemic restrictions along the U.S.-Mexico border that effectively blocked migrants from entering the U.S. to seek asylum, Republicans warned it would worsen the border crisis and potentially help deliver a GOP victory in the midterms.\n\nThe president’s move came after more than a year of pressure from fellow Democrats amid frustration with the inability to end a policy they view as illegal and cruel to those fleeing persecution.\n\nBut the order from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to lift on May 23 what’s known as Title 42 could become another liability for the president and congressional Democrats who already face historical headwinds and an unfavorable political climate partially fueled by soaring inflation and skyrocketing gas prices. The Democrats are trying to maintain their razor-thin majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate in November’s midterm elections.\n\n\"Every Democrat will have to answer for the Biden administration’s decision to turn their border crisis into a border catastrophe,\" National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) spokeswoman Torunn Sinclair argued in a statement to Fox News minutes after the administration’s decision was reported.\n\nPresident Trump's’s administration issued the order amid the coronavirus outbreak. It was used by both the Trump and Biden administrations to expel a majority of migrants at the border. While it is a public health order, not an immigration policy, it has become one of the central border policies in place as the U.S. faces a continuing crisis of numbers at the border. In February, approximately 55% of migrants were returned due to the order rather than being released into the U.S.\n\n\"Title 42 has been nothing short of disastrous for immigrant families seeking asylum from the horrors in their own countries,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said last month. \"It is unacceptable that this policy continues to be used indiscriminately to remove migrants with valid refugee claims from our Southern border.\"\n\nBut with border crossings over the past year at historical highs, the GOP sees Friday’s move by the Biden administration as fresh ammunition on the campaign trail.\n\nThe NRCC, the House GOP re-election arm, has long viewed border security as a winning issue not only in competitive House districts along the nation's southern border, but also across the country, not only with a GOP base that gets fired up over immigration and border security but among independent voters and even some Democrats.\n\n\"This is an American issue. I think it’s going to play everywhere,\" NRCC chair Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., emphasized in an interview with Fox News in February.\n\nThe GOP needs a net gain of just five seats in the 435-member chamber in November to regain the House majority it lost in the 2018 midterms. Among the many targeted districts they’re hoping to flip are a handful of blue seats along the nation’s southern border in Texas and Arizona.\n\nREPUBLICANS SAY BORDER SECURITY ‘WILL PLAY EVERYWHERE IN MIDTERMS’\n\nSenate Republicans need a net gain of just one seat in the 100-member chamber to win back the majority. And one of the Senate Democrats they view as vulnerable is freshman Mark Kelly of Arizona.\n\n\"Senate Democrats like Mark Kelly created this border crisis and have consistently voted against measures to secure the border,\" National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) spokeswoman Katharine Cooksey claimed in a statement to Fox News.\n\n\"Now they’re all powerless to stop Joe Biden from making the crisis even worse. American families are suffering because of Democrats’ reckless, open borders policies.\"\n\nSen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, tweeted that Biden's move was the worst domestic news of the day and the best political news for the GOP, predicting that Democratic senators from border states Arizona and Nevada \"will lose their elections.\"\n\nThe president’s approval rating is a key barometer for his party in a midterm election cycle, and Biden’s standing with Americans has been well underwater for months. But his approval ratings on his handling of border security and immigration are even worse.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe president’s approval on immigration has been at or below 40% for a year in Fox News' national polling. Biden stood at 37% approval and 58% disapproval on his handling of the issue in the most recent Fox News poll conducted March 18-21.\n\nAn average compiled by Real Clear Politics of all the most recent polls that asked about the president’s handling of border security and immigration put Biden’s approval at 34% and disapproval at 58%.",

            "description": "Biden contradicts his own top hurricane expert to push climate agenda",
            "content": "President Joe Biden used part of his remarks in Florida on Wednesday to blame Hurricane Ian, a recent Category 4 storm, on human-caused climate change despite recent pushback from experts.\n\n\"We're in a situation where the Colorado River looks more like a stream,\" Biden said during a speech in Fort Myers, Florida, on Wednesday afternoon. \"There's a lot going on, and I think the one thing this has finally ended is a discussion about whether or not there's climate change, and we should do something about it.\"\n\nBiden visited Fort Myers alongside Gov. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., and Sens. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Rick Scott, R-Fla., to survey Hurricane Ian's damage and reaffirm the federal government's commitment to assist with the state's recovery efforts. Last week, the storm pummeled Florida's west coast, causing more than 100 deaths and over a million residents to lose power.\n\nAs the storm struck Florida, though, several Democrats, left-wing commentators and media outlets claimed its existence and intensity was a result of carbon emissions and global warming. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., even appeared to suggest that voting for Democrats would help avoid future hurricanes.\n\nDEMOCRATS BLAMING CLIMATE CHANGE FOR HURRICANE IAN AT ODDS WITH SCIENCE, EXPERTS SAY\n\nHowever, experts, including the Biden administration's top hurricane expert, have since pushed back against such claims, saying there wasn't enough evidence to tie the storm to climate change.\n\n\"We can come back and talk about climate change at a later time. I want to focus on the here and now. We think the rapid intensification is probably almost done,\" Jamie Rhome, the acting director of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Hurricane Center, told CNN in an interview on Sept. 27.\n\nBIDEN SUGGESTS AMERICANS NOT PROUD OF US IN DIVISIVE FUNDRAISER SPEECH AS FLORIDA PUMMELED BY HURRICANE IAN\n\nAfter CNN anchor Don Lemon reiterated a question about the hurricane being linked to climate change, Rhome again pushed back.\n\n\"I don’t think you can link climate change to any one event. On the whole, on the cumulative, climate change may be making storms worse,\" he continued. \"But to link it to any one event, I would caution against that.\"\n\nA recent NOAA study similarly concluded that it was \"premature to conclude with high confidence\" that human-caused increasing greenhouse gases have had any impact on hurricane activity in the Atlantic.\n\nAnd on Sunday, Michael Shellenberger, an energy policy expert and founder of the group Environmental Progress, tweeted a series of NOAA analyses showing there is no definitive long-term trend in hurricane frequency, there may be a negative trend in land-falling hurricanes since 1900, and there is no long-term trend on increasing hurricane intensity.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn addition, experts told Fox News Digital last week that blaming Hurricane Ian on climate change was inappropriate politicization.\n\n\"Trying to blame global warming for Hurricane Ian not only defies scientific evidence — the clear weight of scientific evidence — but it is a despicable politicization of a real tragedy that requires our attention and focus on the people negatively affected,\" said James Taylor, the president of conservative think tank Heartland Institute.\n\n\"These types of hurricanes existed before SUVs and coal-fired power plants were invented. In fact, they were much more frequent and severe before coal power plants and SUVs.\"",

            "content": "Dozens of climate activists protesting against fossil fuel production blocked multiple emergency service vehicles from driving to their destination in London on Tuesday morning, according to video of the incident.\n\nThe activists, with the climate group Just Stop Oil, laid in the middle of a busy road in the central London neighborhood Knightsbridge, forcing a fire engine and ambulance to divert from their route, the video, published by U.K. media outlet Leading Britain's Conversation (LBC), showed. The protest also halted rush hour traffic, creating a major blockade and forcing police officers to intervene.\n\n\"I’m driving a lady who has to get to hospital with a baby,\" a driver who was one of several blocked by the protest told the activists, LBC reported.\n\nA truck driver told the protesters to stop sitting on the road \"like a bunch of lemons.\"\n\n'MOVE BEFORE I PULL MY GUN OUT': DC DRIVERS IRATE AFTER CLIMATE PROTESTERS BLOCK RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC\n\n\"Where are the police? There’s not one, is there? In 15 minutes, not one,\" a taxi cab driver told LBC.\n\nAnother tax driver said police were slow to act because of the paperwork involved, according to LBC.\n\nJust Stop Oil, though, said 32 of its members were ultimately arrested during the protest. The group also defended the action, saying it was not prepared to watch while \"countless millions\" die from climate change.\n\nCLIMATE ACTIVISTS EMBRACE EXTREME TACTICS, VIOLENCE AS DEADLINE TO 'SAVE THE PLANET' DRAWS NEAR\n\n\"32 supporters of Just Stop Oil have been arrested for peacefully blocking Knightsbridge and Brompton Road,\" Just Stop Oil tweeted. \"All chose to step up into Civil Resistance because it is our only chance to prevent the biggest crisis humanity has ever faced.\"\n\n\"They do not want your sympathy, they want you to step up and join them,\" the group added. \"We are not prepared to watch while the Government plans for countless millions to die. We are going to stop new oil whether those in power agree or not. We are not asking, we are going to make it happen.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the group previously told Fox News Digital that the group was prepared to continue to engage in \"civil resistance\" measures, but was committed to nonviolence.\n\n\"We are basically calling for individuals and institutions to go into civil resistance against the U.K. government, stopping them from one of the biggest acts of criminality in this country's history, in terms of going ahead with fossil fuel, oil, gas, coal projects,\" the spokesperson said in July.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSimilar protests, meanwhile, have taken place in the U.S. where activists have blocked major highways in an effort to spur climate policies. Last week, a group of protesters blocked a major highway into Washington, D.C., in an effort to persuade President Biden to declare a \"climate emergency.\"\n\n\"We do not enjoy putting our bodies on the line, we do it because we must,\" Declare Emergency, the group that organized the protest, tweeted Friday.",

The group also defended the action, saying it was not prepared to watch while \"countless millions\" die from climate change.",

            "description": "Co-host Kayleigh McEnany called the stunt, which targeted Claude Monet's \"Les Meules\" valued at $110 million, a \"desperate cry for attention.\"",
            "content": "\"Outnumbered\" panelists sounded off Monday on the recent demonstrations by climate activists who have vandalized iconic artwork. The latest target: a $110 million Monet painting.\n\nThe two activists threw mashed potatoes on Claude Monet’s \"Les Meules\" Sunday at a museum in Germany. The painting, however, was enclosed in glass and remained undamaged. The pair then glued themselves to the wall.\n\nThis protest comes after activists connected to the Just Stop Oil group smashed cake on the face of a King Charles III waxwork at the Madam Tussauds museum and threw tomato soup on Vincent van Gogh’s \"Sunflowers\" painting at London’s National Gallery.\n\nMcEnany questioned why the protesters took the route of attacking artwork to get their point across.\n\n\"Who watches the protests and thinks, ‘I want to be with these people’?\" she asked the panel.\n\n\"The painting is about the harvest,\" he said Monday. \"Thank God this was protected by glass. But the hypocrisy of this is it's actually a pro-environment painting.\"\n\nCLIMATE PROTESTERS ACCUSED OF ‘BLOOD ON THEIR HANDS’ AFTER 2 DIE IN CRASH AMID TRAFFIC FROM BRIDGE PROTEST\n\nAinsley Earhardt, co-host of \"Fox & Friends,\" called for serious punishments for activists destroying valuable art.\n\nShe noted that the pieces being targeted are part of history and are taught to young children.\n\n\"There need to be consequences,\" she said. \"It’s a work of art literally worth more than $100 million. You should go to prison if you destroy someone’s art or anything that’s of value.\"\n\nEarhardt called the activists criminals and noted they may not receive harsh consequences, as recent criminal justice policies in America allow for their almost immediate release.\n\n\"In California, if you steal under $1,000, you don't go to prison,\" she said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nEarhardt also highlighted an activist tactic of putting spikes on trees with the goal of jamming chainsaws.\n\n\"I really think it's a form of terrorism to advance a political agenda,\" she said.\n\n\"There are consequences, and we need to stop letting these criminals get away with this.\"",

            "content": "The Environmental Protection Agency is asking for public input on how it should spend more than $13 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act on fighting the \"climate crisis\" and advancing \"environmental justice.\"\n\nThe EPA announced Friday that it would be soliciting public comments on how to spend money on things like air quality and climate change projects. The $13 billion comes from the Inflation Reduction Act, legislation that mostly boosted funding for the Democrats’ environmental and health care goals despite its name.\n\n\"The Inflation Reduction Act provides states, tribes, communities and organizations with the unprecedented opportunity to make lasting progress to equitably protect people and the planet from air pollution and climate change,\" said Joseph Goffman, principal deputy assistant administrator for EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation. \"We are eager to engage with all who have a stake in the success of these efforts, and our next steps will be guided by the wisdom and experience from the conversations we have and the feedback we receive over the next several months.\"\n\nEPA SPENDS $50 MILLION ON ‘AIR MONITORING’ FOR ‘MARGINALIZED’ COMMUNITIES WITH BIDEN SPENDING BILL FUNDS\n\nEPA set up a webpage for the public on six grant programs and will collect input on these initiatives through Jan. 18, 2023.\n\nOne grant program will let EPA distribute $5 billion to help states, local agencies and tribes develop and implement \"strong climate pollution reduction strategies.\" Another will send $4 billion to reduce transportation emissions, including by replacing \"dirty heavy-duty vehicles with clean alternatives,\" and a third will spend $1.5 billion to reduce methane emissions in the oil and gas sector.\n\nEPA has said the Inflation Reduction Act, which President Biden signed in August, authorized the \"largest investment to combat the climate crisis in U.S. history.\" In total, the new law allows EPA to spend $41.5 billion on projects to monitor air quality, reduce pollution and support the Biden administration’s goal of \"environmental justice,\" which the administration defines as getting resources to low-income and other \"marginalized\" communities that it says bears the brunt of pollution.\n\nEPA said its goal is to make sure the goals of the Inflation Reduction Act are \"realized by all people, particularly those who have been most burdened by environmental, social, and economic injustice.\"\n\nIn late October, EPA provided nearly $1 billion for electric school buses and focused most of that effort on low-income, rural and tribal school districts.\n\nBIDEN ANNOUNCES EXECUTIVE ACTIONS ON ‘CLIMATE CRISIS,’ FOCUSES ON EXTREME HEAT AND BOOSTING OFFSHORE WIND\n\nThe Biden administration’s climate push has also seeped into other federal agencies. The Department of Health and Human Services runs an Office of Climate Change and Health Equity (OCCHE), which Republicans targeted in October as possible wasteful spending at a time when the health agency should be focused on things like the fentanyl crisis, and when the administration should be more worried about runaway spending.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Wasteful spending on a radical left-wing agenda is par for the course for this administration and has led to historic inflation,\" Republicans on the House Oversight and Reform Committee wrote to HHS last month. \"It raises serious questions as to why HHS is now spending millions of taxpayer dollars and expanding the federal bureaucracy when Americans are struggling to pay their energy bills, buy gas and groceries, and pay for transportation to and from work.\"",

International leaders are expected to continue their push for a global green transition from fossil fuels to clean alternatives like solar and wind power during the summit.\n\n\"The conference allows for virtual participation and the carbon footprint will be offset,\" Alexander Saier, a spokesperson for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) which is hosting the conference, told Fox News Digital in an email.\n\nWhile Saier noted that attendees would be able to attend virtually, he did explain why the UN didn't make the entire event remote. Overall, about 40,000 people, including 24,000 diplomats, had registered to attend the two-week conference as of Wednesday.\n\nJOHN KERRY WILL FLY COMMERCIAL TO UN CLIMATE CONFERENCE FOLLOWING BACKLASH FOR PRIVATE JET CARBON EMISSIONS\n\nPresident Biden and Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry, whose office said he would travel to and from the summit via commercial airline, are expected to lead the U.S. delegation at the event.\n\n\"It's going to be like Davos, where you see all those private jets lined up,\" Steve Milloy, a senior legal fellow at the Energy & Environment Legal Institute, told Fox News Digital in an interview.\n\n\"In America, they expect people to get rid of their pets, to change their diet, to drive electric vehicles to reduce emissions, and here you have these clowns flying around wherever they want, staying in these nice places with a huge carbon footprint,\" he continued. \"Maybe they'll have a vegan meal and call it day.\"\n\nLast year, the UN estimated that its COP26 summit in Glasgow, Scotland, led to a whopping 131,556 tons of carbon dioxide emissions. More than 103,000 tons of the emissions were generated as a result of delegates' travel.\n\nBy comparison, the average annual global footprint is four tons per person, and the average American's footprint is 16 tons a year, according to The Nature Conservancy.\n\nThe conference marked the largest total emissions ever recorded at a UN climate summit.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe UNFCCC has committed to offsetting emissions at its conferences by funding renewable energy projects, implementing energy-efficiency measures and supporting carbon sequestration.",

The UNFCCC has committed to offsetting emissions at its conferences by funding renewable energy projects, implementing energy-efficiency measures and supporting carbon sequestration.",
