            "description": "Climate scientist tells Joe Rogan he won't debate scientists who disagree with him on the science of climate change.",
            "content": "A climate scientist who formerly worked in the Clinton administration admitted to Joe Rogan that he was unwillling to debate scientists who disagreed with him about climate change.\n\nAndrew Dessler, professor of Atmospheric Sciences at Texas A&M University has appeared on MSNBC and CNBC to promote the left’s views on man-made climate change. But the climatologist told Rogan on a February 16 episode of \"The Joe Rogan Experience\", that there was no debate on \"the fact\" of climate change.\n\nDuring the interview, Rogan asked his guest if he had ever \"debated anyone\" over climate change. Dessler stated he did debate a climate skeptic, scientist Richard Lindzen over a decade ago, but it was \"terrible\" and he vowed he would never do it again.\n\n\"My feeling is that I won’t debate the science. So the science is set,\" he stated. \"The temperature is warming, humans have caused it.\"\n\n\"I’m happy to debate policy, because I think policy needs to be debated,\" he added.\n\nPHYSICIST TO TUCKER CARLSON: CLIMATE CHANGE IS 'FICTION OF THE MEDIA'\n\nRogan pushed back on his guest, asking why he was unwilling to debate a scientist who disagreed with him, when it would be \"beneficial\" to the public who doesn’t know who to trust on these issues. The podcast host referenced his guest the week prior, Steve Koonin, a physicist who worked in the Obama administration, who says that science on climate change is not settled, and the media exaggerates it.\n\nBut Dessler claimed it would be too burdensome and time-consuming to \"fact-check\" someone who disagreed with him, in real-time. After Rogan disagreed, saying that there could be clear parameters set for time effectiveness and clarity, Dessler wouldn’t budge, saying he would only debate what policy changes to make to fight against man-made climate change.\n\n\"I think you overestimate the ability to settle these issues in a debate,\" Dessler told Rogan.\n\nThe popular podcast host came under fire recently from the left for allegedly spreading COVID misinformation. Several musicians pulled their music from streaming platform Spotify to pressure the company to take action against Rogan.\n\nIn response, the podcast giant said he would try to bring on more left-leaning guests as a counterpoint to his other guests and took down seventy episodes of his show that featured controversial guests or the use of a racial slur.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSome belive Rogan shouldn't have issued that statement, which some saw as an apology. Governor Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., told Fox News Digital, that he shouldn’t have apologized to the \"mob.\"\n\n\"No, he shouldn't have apologized. I mean, you see what happens? The mob will come after people, and they're targeting Rogan because he's threatening to upset the apple cart on some of the things that they're holding dear. And with COVID, he's just bringing opposing views. He's letting people decide,\" DeSantis said.",

            "description": "The HHS office on climate was established by President Joe Biden during his first week in office.",
            "content": "One of the largest departments in the federal government says it has role to play in safeguarding American’s health from the effects of climate change, and argues this role is \"firmly rooted in public health history.\"\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services is a $2 trillion entity that houses agencies like the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the National Institutes of Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nLast week, the department’s new Office of Climate Change and Health Equity said it was ready to tackle the challenges of climate-related health impacts, just as the government took on sanitation standards and air pollution in decades ago.\n\nWEST VIRGINIA GOVERNOR TORCHES DEMOCRATS' ENERGY AGENDA: HOW CAN ANYBODY DEFEND WHAT'S GOING ON IN DC?\n\n\"The incredibly broad effects of climate change and the many ways it worsens existing inequities in the United States must be met with a swift and sustained public health response,\" wrote John Balbus, the interim director of the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity. \"Our country helped eradicate polio and sanitized our cities. Now we must rise to meet another challenge.\"\n\nBalbus said part of that work is ensuring the health of \"disadvantaged\" groups that would be most affected by climate change.\n\n\"Climate change does not affect all of us the same way. Just as unsanitary urban settings at the turn of the 20th century primarily affected low-income and immigrant communities, climate change likewise often hurts disadvantaged groups most,\" he wrote. As one example, he said if global temperatures rise by 2 degrees Celsius, \"Black and African American individuals are 34% more likely to live in areas with the highest projected increases in childhood asthma.\"\n\nGAVIN NEWSOM'S 2024 CHANCES COULD BE THREATENED BY CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY GRID STRUGGLES\n\nThe Office of Climate Change and Health Equity says it exercises the \"power of convening, coordination and collaboration\" to advance \"climate change and health policy\" as it pursues \"environmental justice and equitable health outcomes.\" Among its priorities are identifying communities with \"disproportionate exposures to climate hazards and vulnerable populations,\" and addressing \"health disparities exacerbated by climate impacts to enhance community health resilience.\"\n\nHHS has also established an Office of Environmental Justice within the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity, which focuses on the \"people of color, disadvantaged, vulnerable, low-income, marginalized, and indigenous peoples\" who are \"disproportionately burdened by environmental hazards.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe new climate change mission at HHS was established by an executive order from President Biden that he released in his first week in office. That order created a special presidential envoy for climate, a role filled by former Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., and gave most major federal departments a climate change mission.\n\nIt specifically instructed HHS to create its Office of Climate Change and Health equity to \"address the impact of climate change on the health of the American people.\" It also asked HHS to establish a working group to lower the risk of climate change to \"children, the elderly, people with disabilities and the vulnerable.\"",

Extreme weather is already causing more suffering, and if we don’t get to net-zero emissions, our grandchildren will grow up in a world that is dramatically worse off,\" he wrote.\n\nGates also wrote that it would be one of the hardest things humans have ever done. One of the world's richest men, Gates has focused particularly on battling climate change in recent years and said that soon becoming a grandfather had affected his thinking about the future.\n\nBILL GATES SQUIRMS AS PBS' JUDY WOODRUFF GRILLS HIM ON PAST TIES TO JEFFREY EPSTEIN: \"WELL, HE'S DEAD, SO…\"\n\n\"Getting to zero will be the hardest thing humans have ever done. We need to revolutionize the entire physical economy—how we make things, move around, produce electricity, grow food, and stay warm and cool—in less than three decades,\" he said in his blog post.\n\nGates wrote that emissions \"rose from 51 billion tons of carbon equivalents to 52 billion tons\" between 2021 and 2022, but that the world was further along on \"getting companies to invest in zero-carbon breakthroughs.\"\n\nThe billionaire Microsoft co-founder added that buildings were a surprising source of carbon emissions.\n\n\"The energy they use for air conditioning, heating, lights, and so on is responsible for nearly 14% of all greenhouse gases.

            "description": "Biden administration's energy policy is playing right into China's hands.",
            "content": "Our country recently received a sobering wakeup call with China’s spy balloon hovering over our skies. The blatant violation of American sovereignty wasn’t just an off-hand stunt, it was emblematic of Communist China’s view that they can get away with any aggressive actions against America with little consequences.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party (CCP) cares first and foremost about displacing the United States from its perch among the world’s powers, and this is particularly true when it comes to powering the world.\n\nAs the Biden administration continues to shift American energy policy away from fossil fuels and toward green alternatives, it’s playing right into China’s hands. More specifically, China’s clean energy supremacy should be viewed as a direct threat to the United States.\n\nChina controls large parts of the supply chains for critical minerals (e.g., copper, nickel, and lithium) and rare earth elements. These materials are absolutely crucial to clean energy technologies, like electric vehicles and solar panels, as well as a range of essential products from smartphones to fighter jets.\n\nCHINA, US HEADING FOR ‘CONFLICT AND CONFRONTATION,' FOREIGN MINISTER WARNS\n\nIn the modern-day gold rush for these irreplaceable building blocks, China is dominating — with the help of Uyghur forced labor and its predatory Belt and Road Initiative that gives high interest loans to developing countries. While CCP does not have a monopoly over upstream production of critical minerals, they have a stranglehold on the midstream and downstream supply chains.\n\nAccording to the International Energy Agency (IEA), China refines between 60 and 70 percent of cobalt and lithium and a stunning 90 percent of rare earth elements\n\nSome on the left, however, say that we must appease China so that they will help us fight climate change. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry has said that the CCP’s human rights horrors are \"not my lane.\"\n\nJust last month, at a Heritage Foundation event about China and Ukraine, a protester took to the stage with a message consistent with Kerry’s actions: \"China’s not our enemy, the climate crisis is.\"\n\nThis mistaken approach toward China is as dangerous as it is delusional. First, from espionage and human rights abuses to supply chain monopolies and intellectual property thefts, the CCP is clearly a massive threat to U.S. sovereignty. Second, China emits more than the whole developed world and is building an astonishing number of coal plants.\n\nMany in the Biden administration, notably John Kerry, are willing to sacrifice national security and human rights concerns in the name of climate policy — but this futile attempt to appease Chairman Xi won’t get the world’s worst emitter to decarbonize any faster than is in its own interests.\n\nJohn Kerry is the Neville Chamberlain of climate change. China interprets this posture as weakness and is exploiting it.\n\nThankfully, there are ways to resist dependence on the CCP for critical minerals and rare earth elements — and do more for the environment than Democrats’ approach.\n\nInstead of denying domestic mining, such as mining in Minnesota for copper and nickel, we need more of it. \"Made in America\" has a national security component, and U.S. mines are much better for our economy, security, and the climate than Chinese mines. Working with our North American allies will also strengthen our supply chains.\n\nAdditionally, we must support innovative developments with two power sources that Democrats have often opposed, reliable and carbon-free nuclear and carbon capture for fossil fuels. We should also diversify our energy mix so we are not overly reliant on one power source or one foreign power — then we can protect this country while remaining the world’s leader in reducing emissions.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nCountering China’s control of clean energy supply chains won’t be easy, and, at least initially, it will be more expensive. But dependence on the CCP is the highest price of all.\n\nSo, while we are focusing on the skies above us right now, let’s not forget the natural resources under our feet — resources we must cultivate to prevent reliance on the CCP for keeping our lights on and homes heated. By mining more, and ensuring reliable access to diverse power sources, we can prevent China from surpassing the United States.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM REP. MICHAEL WALTZ",

            "description": "As war rages in Ukraine, Pentagon focused on climate change  Fox News",
            "content": "Before and even during Russia’s war on Ukraine, Western observers continue to elevate climate change as a significant risk. This merely reveals their utter lack of seriousness.\n\nThere’s a consistent record of elite fear that the masses are consuming the Earth. The predictions of pollution, famine, and death have all been proven wrong as humans are a net resource, not a liability due to ingenuity and adaptation. Thus, the straight line of doom from Timothy Snyder’s \"Black Earth: The Holocaust as History and Warning\" where Snyder improbably concludes the Nazis’ monstrous evil was aimed at dealing with an ecological crisis, to Paul Ehrlich’s \"The Population Bomb\" a generation earlier, to Thomas Robert Malthus, the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834, and the view that the Irish potato famine was an \"effective mechanism for reducing surplus population.\"\n\nNow, of course, the sophisticates say the world will end in heat, storms, drought, and floods—all caused by mankind’s growing prosperity due to the widespread availability of hydrocarbon energy.\n\nYet, just as the population bomb foretold in 1968 never happened—though it did influence policy, as bad ideas are prone to do—neither has, nor will, climate doom. As Bjorn Lomborg and others have pointed out, climate-related death from floods, droughts, storms, wildfire, and extreme temperatures declined almost 100-fold from the 1920s to 2021, even as the global population grew four times from 2 billion to almost 8 billion.\n\nWildfires used to burn about 4.2 percent of the land annually in the early 1900s; now, it’s 2.5 percent. In drought-prone California with its Mediterranean climate that concentrates the vast majority of its precipitation in the winter leaving much of the year dry, wildfires burned on average 4.5% and 12% of the state before 1800—but 2020’s 4.2 percent burn was hyped as a \"climate apocalypse\" rather than the result of poor or nonexistent forest management practices.\n\nLastly, even in the U.S., the cost of flood losses as a share of the economy has steadily declined since the early 1900s.\n\nDangerously, the U.S. Department of Defense—an essential agency that should be focused on existential threats from Russia, with the world’s largest nuclear arsenal, and China, with its nuclear force growing exponentially by the decade—has been caught up in the nonsense. In the DoD’s Climate Risk Analysis report published four months before Russia invaded Ukraine, there isn’t a single mention of Russia nor Ukraine, and China is mentioned once in the context of potentially taking advantage of climate change fears in the \"Indo-Pacific, (due to) sea-level rise and more extreme weather events.\" Never mind that coral-based atolls grow or subside naturally with the sea-level while scientific observations have found \"…significant decreasing trends in global hurricane numbers and ACE (Accumulated Cyclonic Energy) from 1990 to 2021.\"\n\nParadoxically—at least for those unable to weigh risks—Russia’s attack on Ukraine has led to the deaths of some 23,000 people—both military and civilian, made 10 million refugees, and caused $565 billion in property damage.\n\nCompared to climate-related deaths and damage in 2020 and 2021, the war has killed more than did climate extremes in the last two years and caused more damage in barely more than a month of fighting than did weather disasters globally in both 2020 ($210 billion) and 2021 ($329 billion). And even that damage is declining as a share of the world’s economy compared to prior decades as the absolute value of property improvements increase with the global GDP.\n\nFurther adding to the manmade misery is the fact that Russia and Ukraine are major exporters of wheat and other foodstuffs. Ukraine’s farms are under attack and Russia’s farms may be embargoed. Even President Joe Biden predicted the world will see food shortages due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, saying, \"It’s going to be real.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nAdd to the possibility of war-induced famine the record increase in the circulation of the dollar, which has driven U.S. food inflation to 7.9 percent last month, the highest since 1981.\n\nThe war and irresponsible monetary policy will cause far more misery and suffering than any combination of climate extremes. That our leaders are focused on the latter (though only by working to make energy less affordable and less reliable) at the expense of the former shows their incompetence.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThis is illustrated by the spectacle of former Secretary of State and current Climate Envoy John Kerry pleading with dictators to cut their emissions—dictators who laugh at our folly while they prepare for war.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM CHUCK DEVORE",

Even President Joe Biden predicted the world will see food shortages due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, saying, \"It’s going to be real.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nAdd to the possibility of war-induced famine the record increase in the circulation of the dollar, which has driven U.S. food inflation to 7.9 percent last month, the highest since 1981.",

            "description": "The White House launched a plan this week that will deploy $25 billion in taxpayer funding in support of a \"nature-based\" approach to climate change.",
            "content": "The Biden administration said it will direct billions of taxpayer dollars toward \"nature-based\" climate change solutions, which includes plans for \"bringing the power of nature to maximize the value and resilience of military bases.\"\n\nThe White House on Tuesday released its \"Roadmap for Nature-Based Solutions to Fight Climate Change,\" which the White House says will \"put America on a path that will unlock the full potential of nature-based solutions to address climate change, nature loss, and inequity.\" It said $25 billion worth of current and pending projects are already aligned toward this goal.\n\n\"Nature-based solutions\" means actions to protect or restore ecosystems that are also \"solutions to societal challenges,\" such as the conservation of natural areas that help boost resilience to flooding or heat.\n\nPresident Biden initiated this new effort with an executive order he signed on Earth Day this year, which directed federal agencies to pursue nature-based solutions to the climate crisis.\n\nBIDEN’S FINAL WEEK OF CAMPAIGNING PLAGUED WITH GAFFES: ‘WHAT’S HIS NAME?’\n\nOne element of the roadmap calls on the Department of Defense to create a guide for \"nature-based solutions for Military Installation natural resources management planning.\" That guide will \"provide military installation planners and managers with current and actionable information on the appropriate use of nature-based solutions; the current state of science and observed performance reliability; and other considerations regarding design, cost and benefits, implementation, and operations and maintenance.\"\n\nUnder White House direction, an early draft of this guide is due in March 2023.\n\nThe plan calls for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to consider \"nature-based solutions\" as alternatives for all projects that have the potential to affect floodplains or wetlands. It said FEMA has already started to make things easier for \"disadvantaged communities\" to fund projects with \"nature-based solutions.\"\n\nIn addition to finding \"nature-based solutions\" for military installations, the administration said it would look for similar solutions for \"energy, the economy and national security.\" For example, the administration is rating Department of Energy sites for climate sustainability and wants the department to also rate sites on environmental justice and cultural resource protection.\n\nThe plan asks several agencies to expand funding that will help train workers in the area of nature-based solutions, in order to \"support good jobs in federal agencies and the private sector.\" To support that goal, the Department of Treasury will produce reports on \"How Climate Challenges American Household Finances.\"\n\nThe White House noted that federal agencies are already using funding from the 2021 infrastructure law and the Inflation Reduction Act to fund similar priorities. These include conservation, reforestation and habitat restoration led by the Department of Agriculture.\n\nThe Department of Housing and Urban Development is distributing $837.5 million in grant funds and $4 billion in loan authority to improve \"energy efficiency, water efficiency, and climate resilience.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nJohn Podesta, the senior advisor to the president for clean energy innovation and implementation, presented the new White House plan at the opening of the U.S. Center at United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change’s Conference of the Parties. Biden was set to travel to the conference in Egypt on Wednesday.",

            "content": "Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Wednesday that women and children are the \"primary victims of conflict and climate change\" and that the war in Ukraine \"shows us that.\"\n\n\"Women and children are the primary victims of conflict and of climate change and there is no place that unfortunately, tragically, shows us that more dramatically than Ukraine today,\" Clinton told the crowd at the Forbes 30/50 Summit in Abu Dhabi.\n\nClinton, sitting alongside MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" co-host Mika Brzezinski, First Lady of Ukraine Olena Zelenska, former Tennis star Billie Jean King and Gloria Steinem, added that \"there are a lot of other conflicts, a lot of other challenges that we have to take into account.\"\n\nThe former Democratic nominee for president noted \"gender apartheid in Afghanistan\" and the \"persecution and oppression of girls and women, exercising their freedom of choice in Iran and so many other places.\"\n\nDEMS LOOKING BEYOND BIDEN COULD URGE PAST SUPERSTARS LIKE HILLARY CLINTON, AL GORE FOR 2024 TICKET\n\nDuring her opening remarks, Clinton said that women have been \"dramatically set back\" by the COVID-19 pandemic and by \"organized pushback to the advancement of women.\"\n\n\"So I think the bottom line is we have a lot of work to do. And we can’t take any of the progress that has been made for granted, because as you said, Mika, with the Dobbs decision and other kinds of organized institutional pushback, we’re seeing a lot of what we did take for granted in terms of rights and opportunities at risk,\" Clinton said.\n\nTowards the end of the conversation, Clinton encouraged women to accept the fact that they have to be better \"prepared\" than anybody and to \"practice communicating.\"\n\nShe also told the crowd to \"look for allies\" and \"just know that every time you stand up for yourself, you stand up for literally tens of thousands, maybe millions of people who don’t have the voice, or the access, the opportunity that you do.\"\n\n\"That's what Olena is doing, traveling around the world,\" Clinton added in reference to the Ukrainian first lady. \"She is standing up on behalf of her country and the people who are the most vulnerable and marginalized, you don’t have to be in the middle of a horrible war that is breaking every law there is and committing crimes against humanity to stand up and speak out and know that you’re doing it not just for yourself. Somehow that might make it easier.\"\n\nClinton sat down with Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg on Saturday at the Clinton Global Initiative's annual meeting at Vanderbilt University.\n\nButtigieg praised Clinton for putting cracks in the glass ceiling after she asked him about being considered a \"trailblazer\" as the \"first openly gay cabinet member,\" and \"the youngest person to ever hold the office of Secretary of Transportation.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Yeah, I mean, again, I'm humbled to have a word like ‘trailblazer’ used when I'm sitting next to you and knowing all the cracks you put in that glass ceiling,\" Buttigieg responded.",

            "content": "A writer for Vox hit back against claims that climate change will make the world uninhabitable and slammed activists for promoting pessimistic messaging that leave kids with feelings of anxiety and powerlessness.\n\nStaff writer Kelsey Piper wrote Wednesday that books aimed at her 5-year-old daughter regarding climate and conservation have given her a \"new perspective\" on the \"discourse wars\" that often reach children. She noted that the messaging for adults is more nuanced and upbeat in comparison to the dire predictions found in novels like \"Our House Is on Fire: Greta Thunberg’s Call to Save the Planet.\"\n\n\"Yes, some things will be worse, but because of progress on many fronts in addressing extreme poverty and disease, as well as general economic growth, our kids’ lives will be better than our parents’ lives were,\" Piper wrote.\n\nThe Vox writer noted that while climate change may lead to mass migrations and the displacement or the \"extinction of many species,\" it will not make the earth unlivable. In fact, the earth is now a better place to live, especially for low-income countries, \"than it ever has been.\" Climate change is not going to make it as bad as it was, even in the 1950s, Piper asserted.\n\nNEW YORK TIMES ACKNOWLEDGES GREEN CARBON OFFSET CREDITS DON'T WORK: 'TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE'\n\nCritiquing a passage from Thunberg’s children’s illustration book in which the author wonders \"what use is a school without a future,\" Piper said that she was not \"thrilled about the message.\"\n\n\"Some kids might hear that and be inspired to speak before the United Nations, but most kids are going to hear that and be scared and disempowered,\" she wrote.\n\nTHE HILL COLUMN SUGGESTS THE WAY TO FIGHT INFLATION IS TO FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE\n\nHighlighting a 2021 Avaaz poll and a quote from conservation psychologist Susan Clayton, Piper wrote that a majority of young Americans think humanity is \"doomed\" and the earth could be unlivable in as little as 20 years.\n\n\"Why do we see kids saying that? Because books, stories, and protest messaging aimed at them tell them that! There’s pessimism in the water around climate change, and kids often take that pessimism far more literally than adults do,\" Piper argued.\n\nShe added that adults are \"displacing their own frustration\" regarding political climate inaction onto children, and are doing so by telling kids falsehoods about the future of our world.\n\nIn her conclusion, Piper claimed she has been unable to find children’s books that frame climate change as an inevitable threat, rather than a challenge for the next generation that is solvable.\n\n\"If you know of one, I’m in the market for recommendations; if you don’t know, I invite you to think about where this hole in our messages for children leaves them,\" she concluded.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",

            "description": "The WSJ editorial board published an article Thursday arguing that California's energy shortages are not caused by climate change, but instead by climate policies.",
            "content": "The Wall Street Journal editorial board criticized California Governor Gavin Newsom's climate change policies Wednesday, arguing they are causing the state's energy shortages.\n\n\"Californians narrowly averted rolling blackouts on Tuesday, but the threat looms all week amid an unpleasant but not unusual heat wave,\" the editors wrote in an opinion titled \"Gavin Newsom's Dirty Energy Secret.\"\n\n\"This ought to be a warning about how the government force-fed green energy transition is endangering grid reliability, but Democrats and the media can’t break out of their climate-change conformity to think clearly, or think at all,\" they continued.\n\nSEXTON RIPS EU PRESIDENT FOR TELLING PEOPLE THEY NEED TO REDUCE THEIR ELECTRICITY USAGE TO ‘FLATTEN THE CURVE’\n\nCalifornia does not have enough energy to supply consumers' demand and has asked people to reduce using their air conditioning, powering their homes and even charging their electric cars during heat waves. This past week, California's electric grid operator issued an \"energy emergency alert 3,\" its highest alert level.\n\n\"Democrats blame climate change for the state’s week-long warnings to conserve power, but California’s climate hasn’t suddenly changed,\" the Journal's editors wrote. \"What has drastically changed in recent years is California’s electric generation.\"\n\n\"Solar and wind power have rapidly expanded thanks to rich government subsidies along with the state’s renewables mandate,\" the editors wrote.\n\nThey noted that these subsidies have made it more difficult for gas and nuclear generators to make money and, hence, caused the closure of said facilities.\n\nENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVIST WARNS OF ‘DIRE’ ELECTRICITY CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA: ‘INCOMPETENCE PILED ON IDEOLOGY’\n\n\"[T]he result is that the state often lacks sufficient power when the sun goes down,\" they wrote.\n\nThe editors noted that California must \"rely on imports from other states in the evenings\" and that \"these imports are becoming less dependable since California’s neighbors are also losing base-load generators owing to their own renewable buildouts.\"\n\n\"During heat waves that span the Southwest like the one this week, California must resort to emergency measures to reduce electricity demand,\" they wrote.\n\nThe editors warned that \"what starts in California rarely stays in California,\" and \"Americans everywhere will soon be soaked with higher prices for power that is becoming less reliable.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"The grid problems that Californians are enduring will grow and spread as supersized green-energy subsidies and mandates spread their harmful incentives throughput the U.S. economy in coming years. The culprit is the left’s climate policies, not climate change,\" they concluded.",

            "content": "President Biden described the \"heartbreaking\" devastation in Kentucky in a trip to survey damage from floods that have killed nearly two dozen people, suggesting the natural disaster was related to climate change.\n\nBiden landed in Kentucky on Monday to survey the flooding that last week. Biden and First Lady Jill Biden are meeting with Democratic Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and touring the devastation throughout the afternoon.\n\nDuring an open press briefing, Biden brought up climate change as a cause of many disasters that have occurred since he took office.\n\n\"As you all know, we've suffered a consequence of climate change, a significant number of other catastrophes around the nation. Just in the year and a half I've been the president I know over thousands of acres of forests are burning. More forests have burned down in the West than the entire state of New Jersey, New York, all the way down to the Delmarva peninsula,\" said Biden.\n\nThe president praised first responders and a rapid state, government and local response to the crisis and recounted the \"heartbreaking\" stories of families whose homes were destroyed and lives ripped apart.\n\nKENTUCKY FLOODING DEVASTATION ‘NOTHING LIKE I’D EVER SEEN BEFORE,’ WOLFE COUNTY SEARCH AND RESCUE CHIEF SAYS\n\nHe said: \"And Jill and I are grateful for the first responders, and the National Guard, for what you do. You know, I think the first responders at least up until not too long were kind of taken for granted around the country. Not now, after Covid and some of the other things.\n\n\"And you think of how incredibly heartbreaking it is that people-- as you look at those creeks and streams that are now running brown. And you see from the helicopter, you see, automobiles, everything from buses to automobiles to homes, literally in the middle of the water on the side of the road. And you think to yourself, what in God's name happened to those 37 now? Thirty-eight people who are dead, you know, and you hear about the grandmother and granddaughter climb 16 hours to get out of the way and ended up in trouble.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre also stated that the flooding is yet another sign that climate change is exacerbating natural disasters during a press gaggle en route to the commonwealth.\n\nBeshear has deployed more than to the affected region. Victims who lost their homes have had little respite in the days since, with the state suffering 100-degree weather and skyrocketing humidity.\n\nSo far, first responders have rescued some 1,300 people amid the debris of washed-away towns.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBiden declared the flooding a federal disaster last week, giving the state access to federal resources to pay for rescue and rehabilitation efforts.",

            "description": "Harrison Ford frequent flier on private jets despite climate change activism",
            "content": "Harrison Ford, a famous Hollywood actor, has frequently traveled via private jet in recent months despite his well-known climate change activism.\n\nFord's private jet, a multimillion-dollar Cessna Citation Sovereign, has made at least eight trips stretching roughly 5,284 miles and emitting about 35 metric tons of carbon dioxide in less than two months, according to data from ADS-B Exchange and Celebrity Jets.\n\nFord, however, has made regular appearances at global climate conferences, calling upon individuals and government leaders to support efforts to reduce emissions and prevent disastrous global warming.\n\n\"It's hard to read the headlines — floods, fires, famines, plagues — and tell your children that everything is alright,\" he remarked at a conservation summit in France last year. \"It's not alright. Damn it, it's not alright. It's alright to feel frustration, anxiety, grief, but don't run away from it. Cry out for justice, justice for mother nature.\"\n\n\"The Earth has irreplaceable ecosystems rich in carbon and biodiversity,\" he continued. \"By preserving just a small fraction of these wetlands, tropical forests and mangroves, we can protect our wildlife, our air, water, food jobs and climate.\"\n\nFord added that a younger generation of climate activists has the energy and conscience to do \"what we have not yet been able to do.\"\n\n\"If we don't stop the destruction of the natural world, nothing else will matter,\" Ford said during a separate speech at the 2020 Global Climate Action Summit.\n\nBut Ford's jet has emitted more carbon into the environment in less than two months than the average American burns every two years and the average person worldwide burns every nine years. The average carbon footprint of an American is 16 tons a year while the average person worldwide burns about 4 tons a year, according to The Nature Conservancy.\n\nCLIMATE ACTIVISTS EMBRACE EXTREME TACTICS, VIOLENCE AS DEADLINE TO 'SAVE THE PLANET' DRAWS NEAR\n\nOver the last two months, the jet has frequently traveled to and from Los Angeles suburb Hawthorne, California, Jackson Hole, Wyoming, and Idaho Falls, Idaho, the flight tracking data showed.\n\nThe longest tracked flight was a 1,203-mile trek from Wichita, Kansas, to Hawthorne. That trip alone burned seven metric tons of carbon.\n\nA representative for Ford didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nCLIMATE ACTIVIST STEVEN SPIELBERG'S PRIVATE JET HAS BURNED $116,000 WORTH OF JET FUEL IN TWO MONTHS\n\nFord, though, is not the only celebrity and climate activist to prefer private jet travel over commercial airlines.\n\nHollywood director Steven Spielberg burned a whopping $116,159 worth of jet fuel between June 23 and Aug. 22, Fox News Digital previously reported. Spielberg's Gulfstream G650 flew more than 17,000 miles and burned at least 179 metric tons of carbon in that time span.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio has flown via private jet and traveled long distances on yachts while pushing extreme climate measures and financially supporting nuisance lawsuits against Big Oil firms. The actor flew approximately 8,000 on a private jet in 2016 to receive an environmental award.\n\nIn addition, Taylor Swift and members of the Kardashian family have faced heat recently for their frequent private jet usage.",

            "description": "The Washington Post used examples of domestic abuse in Asia and Africa to argue that climate change events \"have led to escalating threats against women and girls.\"",
            "content": "The Washington Post used the suffering of abused women in Asia and Africa to argue that \"more frequent and intense extreme weather events have led to escalating threats against women and girls.\"\n\n\"Heat waves, floods, climate-induced disasters increase sexual harassment, mental and physical abuse, femicide, reduce economic and educational opportunity and increase the risk of trafficking due to forced migration,\" Terry McGovern, an expert on \"Population and Family Health,\" told The Post.\n\nThe Washington Post's tweet of the article soon received backlash on Twitter, with reporter Tatjana Pasalic responding to the article by tagging the CEO of The Babylon Bee, a conservative satire site. \"damnit @SethDillon,\" she wrote.\n\nPETE BUTTIGIEG BROUGHT HUSBAND CHASTEN ON MILITARY AIRCRAFT TO ATTEND SPORTING EVENT IN NETHERLANDS\n\nThe article used McGovern and other \"scientists\" to contend that domestic violence was closely linked to climate change. And the problem was global in scale, according to The Post.\n\n\"For these and many other women around the world, the threat of violence could become more common as climate change makes extreme weather events more intense and frequent.\"\n\nThe liberal media has taken flack in recent weeks for raising the stakes on climate rhetoric, with one New York Times columnist recommending that mating \"with shorter people\" could help save the planet from destruction.\n\nNEW YORK TIMES MOCKED FOR ESSAY ON SHORT PEOPLE BEING BETTER FOR THE PLANET: 'RIDICULOUS'\n\n\"60 Minutes\" rang in the New Year with a segment featuring the disgraced author and biologist behind \" ,\" a book that predicted four billion would die from starvation by 1989.\n\nThe \"doomsday celebrity,\" as CBS host Scott Pelley called biologist Paul Ehrlich, took to Twitter to whine about the \"right-wing\" backlash against his \"60 Minutes\" appearance.\n\n\"If I'm always wrong so is science, since my work is always peer-reviewed, including the POPULATION BOMB and I've gotten virtually every scientific honor. Sure I've made some mistakes, but no basic ones.\"\n\nThe tweet was soon eviscerated online by a collection of journalists and even YouTuber Hank Green.\n\nPodcast host Noah Blum mocked Ehrlich’s tweet, summing up his argument. \"I’m not wrong. Source: me.\"\n\n'60 MINUTES' USES FAILED DOOMSDAY BIOLOGIST TO PREDICT 'MASS EXTINCTION' OF HUMANITY\n\nThe Washington Post later undermined its warnings of climate change fueling abuse because it wasn’t totally scientific.\n\n\"Unlike the hard science of climate change, they said, the complex drivers of violence cannot easily be captured in numbers.\"\n\nAs a result, the article explained, multiple \"academics, activists and humanitarian workers said the links between violence against women and extreme weather events need more research.\"\n\nAnd a final concession from the Post: \"Scientists emphasize that extreme weather events do not cause domestic or gender-based violence, but instead exacerbate existing pressures or make it easier for perpetrators to carry out such violence.\"\n\nFox News’ Scott Whitlock and Lindsay Kornick contributed to this report.\n\nCLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",

            "content": "The Washington Post took harsh criticism after a recent op-ed linked climate change to domestic violence. \"Outnumbered\" panelists sounded off on the liberal outlet’s \"nonsense\" conclusion, warning it diminishes the seriousness of abuse.\n\nTerry McGovern, head of the Population and Family Health department at Columbia University, claimed in the op-ed that worsening climate conditions are to blame for increasing violence.\n\n\"Heat waves, floods, climate-induced disasters increase sexual harassment, mental and physical abuse, femicide, reduce economic and educational opportunity and increase the risk of trafficking due to forced migration,\" McGovern wrote.\n\nMYSTERIOUS ECO GROUP IS FUNDING LOCAL CLIMATE JOURNALISM: ‘ADVOCACY DRESSED UP AS NEWS REPORTING’\n\nFox News contributor Lisa Boothe questioned why the left is so eager to link issues to climate change.\n\n\"Turbulence on a plane, gun violence, everything is being attributed to climate change. And then now this, domestic abuse,\" she told the \"Outnumbered\" panel. \"Why is there this effort by the left, by the media, to draw a linear connection to climate change on essentially every issue?\"\n\nMartha MacCallum, anchor of \"The Story,\" noted that climate change is the top issue being discussed across the Americas, with former Pentagon officials even calling it a threat to national security.\n\nShe said labeling issues as a result of climate change is a convenient way to bring people’s attention to the topic but argued it has unfortunate consequences for people who have been affected by real problems.\n\n\"It siphons off what their issue is, what they're suffering from,\" MacCallum said. She explained that increases in domestic violence are also seen during times of war or when people are suffering economically.\n\n\"It feels a bit disingenuous to say the least,\" she argued.\n\n\"Outnumbered\" co-host Emily Compagno argued the real cause of domestic violence is ineffective laws and enforcement, which receives less attention when the focus is on climate change.\n\n\"The travesty to me is that The Washington Post publishes this op ed, this nonsense, and takes that space away from actual arguments, from actual facts,\" she said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nCompagno encouraged people to start with state and local laws if they want to advocate for change. She stressed the difficulty in obtaining a restraining order and noted that many people who commit violence against their partner were already known to law enforcement.\n\n\"Climate change? Get out of here,\" she said. \"That was a travesty.\"",

Except yesterday I was shown video of Ellen harassing young Taylor Swift about the guys she's dated despite Swift literally begging her to stop, setting a boundary again and again, and clearly nearly crying. As a woman, it made my stomach turn,\" she tweeted.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom also recently blamed climate change for the intense storms in the state.\n\n\"Hot’s getting a lot hotter,\" Newsom said. \"Dry’s getting a lot dryer.

            "title": "This Supreme Court ruling could upend everything about climate change lawsuits",
            "description": "Progressive states and cities have launched a new frenzy of lawsuits in state courts demanding billions of dollars for damages allegedly related to climate change.",
            "content": "Federal courts of appeals cannot agree whether climate change lawsuits are governed by state or federal law. Some federal courts have also concluded these cases should proceed in state court, an outcome Judge David Stras – a respected jurist on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit – just last week called \"confounding,\" even if correct. It’s time for the Supreme Court to intervene.\n\nFor over a century, the Supreme Court has held that lawsuits over air (and water) pollution that crosses state lines must be decided under federal law. This means overreaching states and cities cannot impose their environmental agendas on their neighbors or otherwise hijack the domain of federal environmental law, federal regulations and international treaties.\n\nThe Supreme Court unanimously extended this principle in American Electric Power Co. v. Connecticut (AEP). That case, decided in 2011, involved federal-law claims by eight states, New York City, and others to compel certain power companies to abate their greenhouse-gas emissions.\n\nIn an opinion by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the court concluded that applying federal law was appropriate, then agreed with the Obama administration that those claims couldn’t proceed in court at all because Congress has delegated the regulation of greenhouse-gas emissions to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Clean Air Act.\n\nDissatisfied with AEP, progressive states and cities have since changed tack in their litigation offensive against energy companies. In recent years they have launched a new frenzy of lawsuits demanding billions of dollars for damages allegedly related to past, present and future climate change. But this time, instead of relying on federal law, they have tried invoking state law.\n\nThe 2nd Circuit in 2021 dismissed such claims outright in City of New York v. Chevron Corp. There, New York City sued a handful of energy companies under state law for damages allegedly caused by climate change. The court concluded that \"over a century\" of Supreme Court precedent makes clear that federal law necessarily applies to lawsuits relating to air pollution that crosses state lines, which includes greenhouse-gas emissions. Following AEP, the Second Circuit dismissed the case.\n\nThat 2nd Circuit decision creates a split with the 1st, 4th and 10th Circuits, which have held that state law may apply to climate change lawsuits. Further complicating matters, a second split has developed after plaintiffs began bringing these state claims in state court, where they think the judges will be more sympathetic. Decisions in the 2nd, 5th and 11th Circuits support allowing the defendants to move such cases to federal court, but‌ the 3rd, 4th, 8th, 9th and 10th Circuits disagree.\n\nThree of these cases are now before the Supreme Court—the 3rd Circuit’s decision in Delaware v. BP America Inc., the 9th Circuit’s decision in Chevron Corp. v. San Mateo County and the 10th Circuit’s decision in Suncor Energy (U.S.A.) Inc. v. Board of County Commissioners of Boulder County. The energy companies in each case have asked the court to intervene and resolve both splits, reaffirming that climate change lawsuits are inherently governed by federal law and therefore belong in federal court.\n\nA circuit split significantly increases the likelihood the Supreme Court will review a case, something progressives are desperate to avoid after their crushing (and unanimous) loss in AEP. So, in an effort to escape this review at all costs, they now minimize the splits in authority. They entirely discount the 2nd Circuit’s decision in City of New York, for example, because the plaintiffs there chose to file in federal court, rather than state court. But that distinction has no bearing on whether federal law inherently governs climate change lawsuits.\n\nMore importantly, even if there is no circuit split – and there are two – the stakes are simply too high for the Supreme Court to ignore.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nClimate change lawsuits are currently pending against dozens of major energy companies in states across the country, including Rhode Island, New York, Maryland, Washington, California and Hawaii. These cases are undisguised \"lawfare,\" which is a cynical ploy by environmental activists to achieve through courts what they cannot accomplish at the federal ballot box.\n\nJudge Stras recognized the litigation as nothing more than an \"attempt to set national energy policy\" and \"‘effectively override... the policy choices made by’ the federal government and other states.\" It threatens to interfere with U.S. energy independence, national security and economic growth.\n\nIt is well established that the Supreme Court will decide cases presenting \"important\" questions of federal law. The court has heard many such cases without circuit splits, including on ObamaCare, vaccine mandates, and, as particularly relevant here, greenhouse-gas emissions. The importance of the law governing climate change litigation, and where those cases should proceed, is no different. Even Judge Stras called out for the court to get involved.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nProgressive state and local officials should not be able to use their state laws and state courts to manipulate energy policy and hold every other state, the federal government, and the national energy supply hostage to their climate agendas.\n\nThe Supreme Court has a chance in BP America, Chevron Corp., or Suncor Energy to stop an abusive litigation practice, resolve circuit splits, and preserve over a century of its precedent. It shouldn’t hesitate to do so.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY C. BOYDEN GRAY\n\nAmb. C.

This ruling could upend everything about climate change litigation, and it is time for the Supreme Court to intervene. For example, Judge David Stras of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit concluded that applying federal law was appropriate, then agreed with the Obama administration that those claims couldn't proceed in court at all because Congress has delegated the regulation of greenhouse-gas emissions to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Clean Air Act. The 2nd Circuit in 2021 dismissed such claims outright in City of New York v. Chevron Corp. and 3rd Circuit in Delaware v. BP America Inc., the 9th Circuit’s decision in Chevron Corp., and the 10th Circuit in Suncor Energy (U.S.) Inc. have asked the court to intervene and resolve both splits.",

            "content": "Tuesday on \"Hannity,\" former Energy Secretary Rick Perry said that President Biden's administration \"truly is willing to put the world in jeopardy to send a message to his buddies on the political side of things that he's going to hold firm for them on this climate change issue.\"\n\n\"He really dislikes the oil and gas industry so much that he's willing to jeopardize not just our future, but the future of our allies around the world. It is unconscionable,\" added Perry.\n\nUKRAINE WAR HAS BIDEN PARALYZED BY INEPTITUDE AND MAKING MAJOR MISTAKES ON ENERGY\n\nPerry also highlighted that Saudi Arabia is considering accepting the Yuan rather than U.S. Dollar for Chinese oil sales.\n\n\"The idea that we were - our country, led by our president - going to Venezuela, going to Iran, going to countries that hate us and asking them to increase their [energy] production wasn't lost on the Saudis. They watch that, they see a president who attacks the natural resources in their country, and then they see this president go and deal with the Iranians,\" Perry said.\n\nPerry noted that Iran \"hates\" Saudi Arabia and directly conflicts with the Saudis daily. Iran even attacked a Saudi refinery while Perry served as energy secretary, he said.\n\n\"This message from the Biden administration to the rest of the world, but particularly to the woke left, that I'm going to do what you demand me to do, which is bring the oil and gas industry to its knees. That message is being heard loud and clear from the boardrooms across America to the federal reserve, all across this country,\" Perry said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe United States has \"an enormous amount of energy\" available, he added.",

            "description": "Mark Ruffalo claimed the war in Ukraine is a \"gift\" to President Biden to help make America's transition to clean energy happen.",
            "content": "Actor Mark Ruffalo claimed Tuesday that the war in Ukraine has been a \"gift\" for President Joe Biden’s climate change initiatives and called on the president to \"use\" people’s \"fear,\" \"disgust\" of the war in Ukraine and \"energy prices\" to push the transition to green energy.\n\nDuring a segment on MSNBC Reports, the Hollywood actor and climate activist talked to host Katy Tur about how to beat the \"dark money groups,\" like the Koch Brothers, that are allegedly preventing America’s transition to clean, renewable energy.\n\n\"How do you fight against the advocacy groups out of there, the dark money groups out of there, that are out there that fight against climate change?\" Tur asked her guests, who also included Environmental Defense Action Fund Board Director Kevin Johnson.\n\n\"I mean, the Koch brothers, there’s all sorts of dark money that has stopped solar energy in Arizona. Arizona, which has the most sunlight!\" she added. She then asked, \"So, how do you, with this campaign, cut through the mis and disinformation?\"\n\nMSNBC ANALYST: ELON MUSK'S FREE SPEECH IS 'WHITE MEN' SAYING WHATEVER THEY WANT\n\nAfter Johnson and Tur discussed the question, Ruffalo broke in and insisted that the transition to renewable energy will happen whether it’s messy or not, and whether the Koch brothers are in the way or not.\n\nHe stated, \"On the Koch brothers. Yeah, there is the dark money and that’s definitively an issue, but when you look at how quickly we are actually moving on this transition, when you look at how many jobs it's created… it doesn't matter what the Koch brothers say or do.\"\n\nRuffalo insisted, \"At the end of the day, we are going to win and we are going to transition over.\" He mentioned that the only question is, \"Are we going to do it in a graceful way or are we gonna do it … kicking and screaming?\"\n\nJOY REID SCREECHES DESANTIS’ ‘PRIVATE POLICE FORCE’ WILL ‘INTIMIDATE’ BLACK PEOPLE ‘OUT OF BEING ABLE TO VOTE’\n\nDespite the tragedy in Ukraine, Ruffalo insisted that the war was a \"gift\" for Biden and his climate change agenda and said the president can use Americans’ angst over it to push that agenda.\n\nHe asserted, \"This is a moment for President Biden to take this, our momentum, people's fear, their disgust of the war, their disgust with energy prices and--and use that to solidify a message to the American people that now is the time to transition.\n\n\"This where the jobs are, this is where national security is, and we’re going to keep pushing him to do it and this is a gift to the president as we see it and we see him accepting it in such terms,\" Ruffalo concluded.\n\nMeanwhile, other climate activists have been concerned the war in Ukraine would be a distraction from climate change policy. NBC weatherman Al Roker worried it would \"push back the initiative,\" while climate czar John Kerry bemoaned, \"you're going to lose people's focus.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",

            "description": "Climate change proposals putting American food supply at risk, says dairy farmer",
            "content": "A fourth-generation dairy farmer fears that possible climate initiatives could threaten independent farmers and their ability to provide for the U.S. food supply.\n\nSeveral nations have imposed regulations on the agriculture industry, such as limits on nitrogen emissions, which have sparked backlash from farmers in those countries. The Biden administration, too, has indicated that it aims to push changes on the industry to tackle climate change.\n\n\"Americans are feeding into this lie that climate change is because of agriculture and climate change is not going to get better until farmers and ranchers do better,\" Stephanie Nash, a fourth-generation dairy farmer, told Fox News.\n\nIn 2020 the EPA estimated that at 11% of the U.S.'s total greenhouse gas emissions came from the agriculture sector, compared to 27% from transportation, 25% from energy, and 24% from industry.\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IS HERE AND CONGRESS MUST ACT NOW TO CREATE A CLEANER, HEALTHIER WORLD\n\nPresident Biden, in his first congressional address, floated paying farmers to grow cover crops, which are planted to cover the soil rather than for harvesting, to reduce carbon dioxide and improve soil health. It also encouraged the Department of Agriculture to use farm aid funding to incentivize carbon emission reduction on farms.\n\nMost recently, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) released a new ESG proposal in March which would require companies to report the environmental impact of its practices. If enacted, American farmers and ranchers would be left vulnerable as major food-production corporations could look toward buying small farms or importing animal products to preserve their ESG rating.\n\nNash fears the effort to implement green policies across the globe will continue to kill off an already struggling farming industry that's faced with skyrocketing costs for labor, fuel, seed and fertilizer. She said institutions like the World Economic Forum are \"scaring us\" with its prediction that by 2050 the global population will demand 70% more food than is consumed today and advocates for an overhaul of food production to meet that supply.\n\nWORKING AMERICANS 'ARE GOING TO PAY THE PRICE' FOR BIDEN'S CLIMATE CHANGE AGENDA: THE BIG SUNDAY SHOW\n\n\"Well, if you continue to kill off our food supply and our American farmers, yeah, we're not going to have enough food,\" she said.\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act introduced last week would spend $369 billion on various climate change initiatives. The bill claims it would reduce carbon emissions by roughly 40% by 2030 (CAN YOU LINK TO THE BILL?) , primarily through investing in renewable energy production and practices.\n\nFOOD BANKS IN AMERICA EXPERIENCE SURGING DEMAND: 'NO SIGN OF IT SLOWING DOWN ANY TIME SOON'\n\nThe Dutch government announced its plan to reduce nitrogen emissions by 50% in June, causing a major backlash among the nation's farmers. To meet its goal, the plan requires a 30% reduction in the number of Dutch livestock, whose manure produces nitrogen oxide, forcing many farms out of business.\n\nSimilarly, the Canadian government proposed a 30% cut to nitrogen emissions from fertilizer by 2030 as part of a plan to get to net zero in the next three decades, sparking backlash from farmers. And New Zealand proposed a plan to tax farmers for the emissions from their livestock’s farts and burps.\n\nNash, who said her family moved their century-old dairy farm from California to Tennessee in 2015 due to the Golden State’s restrictive agriculture policies limiting water usage, fears the U.S. will follow suit in implementing restrictive policies on livestock farmers already struggling to stay afloat amid increasing production costs and existing regulatory restrictions.\n\nShe said the push by corporations and wealthy individuals like Bill Gates to shift away from animal products toward plant-based food is rooted in misinformation and ulterior motives.\n\n\"They can say it's for the future, and they want to feed Americans, but honestly, they're putting chemically grown food into our bodies,\" she said. Imitation meats like Beyond Meat contain synthetic preservatives and Red #3 food dye which was banned by the FDA for use in cosmetics in 1990, according to the Center for Consumer Freedom.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLooking ahead, Nash said to look out for the 2025 Farm Bill, legislation passed roughly once every five years, which she fears will be used to give the EPA more access to and control over independent farmers.\n\n\"There's not a backbone in Washington, D.C. and there's not enough family farmers and ranchers in office to protect us around the United States,\" she said.",

            "description": "A Washington Post report from Thursday cited two studies that linked climate change to a rise in \"hate speech\" and violent behavior, blaming higher temperatures.",
            "content": "Washington Post weather reporter Amudalat Ajasa wrote that researchers are worried that hotter temperatures caused by climate change are spurring a rise in \"hate speech.\"\n\nIn her Thursday report, titled, \"Hotter days bring out hotter tempers, research finds,\" Ajasa cited two studies that show that because of climate change, hotter temperatures are inducing people to engage in \"hate speech and hostile behavior.\"\n\nAjasa wrote, \"As temperatures around the world increase, scientists have documented large-scale environmental effects — rising sea levels, drought and famine, intense flooding and the disappearance of species. But increasingly, some researchers worry that higher temperatures might also contribute to people behaving badly.\"\n\nWISCONSIN VOTERS SAY INFLATION, CLIMATE CHANGE ARE AMONG THEIR TOP VOTING PRIORITIES AHEAD OF MIDTERMS\n\nShe added, \"Two recent studies add to the idea by showing that when it gets hot out, people are more prone to hate speech and hostile behavior.\"\n\nAccording to the one of the studies, \"hate speech on social media escalated with high temperatures.\" The other found that there was \"an increase in workplace harassment and discrimination at the U.S. Postal Service when the temperature eclipsed 90 degrees.\"\n\nAjasa noted that these studies are just part of a \"growing literature connecting heat to aggressive behavior.\"\n\nDelving more specifically into the data, the reporter cited the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research’s study which found an \"increase of hate speech of up to 22 percent on Twitter when temperatures are above 107 degrees Fahrenheit.\" Not only that, but \"extreme cold\" coincided with a rise in \"offensive tweets.\"\n\nShe noted offensive tweets saw \"a 12.5 percent increase when it was below 27 degrees.\"\n\nAjasa claimed that scientists made these findings by using \"a machine-learning algorithm to analyze 75 million hate tweets from a database containing over 4 billion tweets posted by people across the United States between 2014 and 2020. The tweets spanned 773 cities.\"\n\nThe algorithm showed that \"Aggressive behavior was the tamest between 54 to 70 degrees, according to the peer-reviewed study, published in the journal Lancet Planetary Health.\" It also found that \"temperatures above 81 degrees were consistently linked to significant increases in online hate across all climate zones.\"\n\nAjasa added, \"As summers get warmer and the number of heat waves increases, researchers fear that there will be an increase in online hate.\"\n\nThe author quoted University of Michigan associate professor Libby Hemphill to bolster the claim. She said, I do think that as living in a climate impacted world increases our stress and precarity, we will see increases in aggression online as well.\"\n\nHemphill, who the piece said studies \"hate speech and social media,\" added, \"It makes sense to me that climate threat would have the same impact or a similar impact to all these other types of threats that stress people out and make them lash out.\"\n\nAjasa also cited Iowa State University professor Craig Anderson, who said, \"As global warming increases, there will be, in fact already is, an increase in the frequency with which people are uncomfortably warm or uncomfortably hot. That in itself can lead to decision-making and behaviors that are more aggressive and under some circumstances can lead to increases in violent behavior.\"\n\nThe weather reporter concluded her piece, saying, \"Experts agree that slowing climate change could keep heat-inflamed behavior in check.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",

            "title": "GREG GUTFELD: Climate change activists 'win over no one' with these stunts",
            "description": "Fox News host Greg Gutfeld shares his take on how modern activists have begun to protest climate change on Tuesday's 'Gutfeld!'",
            "content": "Happy Tuesday, everybody. It's great to see every one of you except for you over there. So, once again, protesters attacked expensive pieces of art. And no, I'm not talking about my quads, though they are pricey and worth it.\n\nThis time it's an Andy Warhol in Milan, Italy. On Friday, the attention-seeking freaks threw flour on a sports car painted by the pop artist in 1979. Pop artist. Fortunately, the Italian police sprang into action and formed it into a pizza crust. But the event is just another in a trend by young psychotics who vandalize art with food or paint. Although such actions might improve a Jackson Pollock. A little art humor there for all you sophisticates.\n\nAnd does anybody else find it ironic? The one piece of art they don't throw soup on is this one. I guess it's redundant. Now, every time we report on this, I get a little angry. But then again, I'm 5'5\", so what other kind of angry can I get? But the whole point - I am. But the whole point of this vandalism is to get suckers like me to report on their cause. So let's ignore the cause. I don't even know what it is. I don't know what it is. Instead, let's focus on the freaks who destroy their cause with each stunt, they win over no one.\n\nFor every painting they attack, I'll eat another cow. Hell, I might even push one out of my coal-powered jet. No, but it's going to be great. That sound they make when they land, yeah. But the big story here, it's not just gender that's no longer binary. It's sanity. Those people breaking these laws appear to be certifiable. Look at them. They're madness personified. They're sad, and they're gross. If they didn't spend their time throwing vegan corn chowder on Mona Lisa's ****, they'd have no lives at all.\n\nIn the old days, they'd be carted off, placed in comfy cells with padded walls. Kat knows what I'm talking about. You know, thank God I helped her get it straight. You're welcome, Kat. But now they're not even bumrushed by security. Judging by how little effort these guards make, you'd think they weren't protecting a Warhol, but this. I can draw Binky.\n\nIn fact, you've got to wonder if these aren't inside jobs. I mean, who lets people into a gallery while they're carrying containers of flour or paint cans? Not that art museum guards should be SEAL Team Six, but if you see a bunch of nose ring green hairs carrying bags of flour or cans of soup or paint, you can bet they aren't there to smile back at the Mona Lisa.\n\nInsanity used to be easily defined, but now we've redefined unstable behavior as passionate. But you know who else was passionate about the environment? Charles Manson and his passionate family of human scum. Before, we used to look at these people and say, \"Well, that's one point of view.\" Now relax while some men in white coats chase you with a giant butterfly net. Remember those nets? Those are great.\n\nNow it's, \"Wow, they're so dedicated. Let's hear them out. They must really believe in this cause to scream in strangers faces and smear poop on the walls.\" Or maybe they're just getting ready to host \"Jesse Waters Primetime.\" That's all you need to do.\n\nSo we're now at the mercy of scammers and mentally damaged people. These are desperate, isolated souls with no real sense of the world, and they're gaining traction. Joe Biden and his pals at the UN climate conference has agreed to pay up to $1 billion in so-called climate reparations to poor nations for damage apparently caused by the West's fossil fuel use.\n\nYeah, let's apologize for raising the standard of living for 90% of the human population on the planet and be punished by the 10% who couldn't keep up. Sorry world for the AC, the combustion engine, irrigation systems, sewage treatment plants, dishwashers, electricity. So here's a couple billion while you continue to burn things far worse than coal.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAnd here's the kicker. The world's biggest emitter doesn't have to pay a dime. And no, not Eric Swalwell. It's communist China. And why? Because it's still considered a developing nation. Yeah, that makes real sense. Calling China developing nation is like calling Dolly Parton a developing female.\n\nBut let's face it, China is smarter than us. They don't buy into this progressive ****. They don't see sex as non-binary. As a matter of fact, they see the world as binary as the computer technology they steal from us. They see the world as ones and zeros. And they're the ones and everybody else are zeros. And they laugh at us for falling for this crap.\n\nSo we've now embraced insanity as an alternative lifestyle. It's the elimination of standards. The destruction of beauty, whether it's in art or one's own body. Activists destroy priceless paintings as easily as they butcher their own healthy bodies. It's like our society is experiencing a sort of a mental illness as a whole.\n\nBefore, if someone couldn't participate in civilized life, we'd get them help. Now, we can't even say who's mentally ill at all. Which might be the new definition of crazy. And most of this stuff is coming out of Tik-Tok. And who owns that? China. It's a brilliant strategy. Destroy from within by giving the vacuous West exactly what they can't resist.",

            "title": "Global elites took 150+ private jets to fight climate change in Davos",
            "description": "World leaders converged on Davos, Switzerland, last week to talk about major issues including climate change, but traveled largely to the summit on private jets.",
            "content": "Business executives, celebrities, billionaires and government officials traveled to the World Economic Forum (WEF) summit last week largely using private jets, according to a Fox News Digital analysis of flight data.\n\nDuring the conference, which began on Jan. 16 and concluded Friday, at least 150 private jets flew into three of the closest airstrips near WEF's headquarters in Davos, Switzerland, according to data obtained from flight tracking software Flightradar24. The data suggests that conference attendees spewed hundreds of thousands of pounds and thousands of metric tons of carbon as a result of their private jet usage.\n\n\"Europe is experiencing the warmest January days ever recorded and communities around the world are grappling with extreme weather events supercharged by the climate crisis,\" Klara Maria Schenk, a campaigner for environmental group Greenpeace International, said in a statement ahead of the conference.\n\n\"Meanwhile, the rich and powerful flock to Davos in ultra-polluting, socially inequitable private jets to discuss climate and inequality behind closed doors,\" she continued.\n\nECO GROUP SLAMS DAVOS SUMMIT AS GLOBAL ELITES ARRIVE IN PRIVATE JETS TO TALK CLIMATE POLICY\n\nPrivate jet travel is by far the most carbon-intensive mode of transportation. They are about 10 times more carbon-intensive than commercial planes and 50 times more carbon-intensive than trains, according to a 2021 report from the group Transport & Environment.\n\nThe flight data broadly showed private jets traveling to the region from various cities around Europe and others from the U.S. and Asia.\n\nFor example, on Jan. 15, a Gulfstream G650 jet traveled from Salt Lake City, Utah, to Friedrichshafen Airport, a small airstrip two hours north of Davos. The nine-hour flight burned an estimated 44 metric tons of carbon, according to an emissions calculator created by the firm Paramount Business Jets.\n\nJOHN KERRY'S FAMILY PRIVATE JET EMITTED OVER 300 METRIC TONS OF CARBON SINCE BIDEN TOOK OFFICE\n\nAnother long-distance private jet flight — from West Palm Beach, Florida, to Friedrichshafen Airport on a Bombardier Global 6000 jet on Jan. 16 — burned roughly 42 metric tons of carbon. And a four-hour flight on Friday from Baku, Azerbaijan, to St. Gallen–Altenrhein Airport on the same model aircraft emitted about 23 metric tons of carbon.\n\nBy comparison, the average person worldwide has an estimated annual carbon footprint of four tons.\n\nIn addition, dozens of the private jet trips tracked by Fox News Digital were short-distance flights from bordering countries.\n\nIn one example, on Tuesday, an Embraer Phenom 300 jet traveled just 31 minutes from Milan, Italy, to St. Gallen–Altenrhein Airport. On Thursday, a Cessna 680A Citation Latitude flew 53 minutes from Prague, Czech Republic, to the same airport.\n\nOther short-distance flights came from Buochs, Switzerland; Speyer, Germany; Frankfurt, Germany, Turin, Italy; Salzburg, Austria; Nice, France; Lyon, France and Cannes, France.\n\nMeanwhile, the WEF conference's agenda focused largely on environmental issues like climate change and achieving net-zero ambitions. The conference's program highlighted the top priority as \"addressing the current energy and food crises in the context of a new system for energy, climate and nature.\"\n\nPETE BUTTIGIEG TOOK GOVERNMENT JET TO NYC FOR RADIO INTERVIEW, ACLU MEETING BEFORE FLYING BACK HOURS LATER\n\nAnd several high-profile climate activists and officials, such as Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry and former Vice President Al Gore, attended the summit, imploring fellow attendees to double down on climate commitments.\n\n\"When you start to think about it, it's pretty extraordinary that we — select group of human beings because of whatever touched us at some point in our lives — are able to sit in a room and come together and actually talk about saving the planet,\" Kerry remarked on Tuesday. \"I mean, it's so almost extraterrestrial to think about ‘saving the planet.’\"\n\nWhile the three airports — St. Gallen–Altenrhein Airport, Samedan Airport and Friedrichshafen Airport — analyzed by Fox News Digital are popular airstrips for individuals traveling to WEF summits, previous studies of private jet travel to Davos have tracked flights into four additional airports including Geneva Airport and Zurich Airport, two major international travel hubs.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSuch studies have determined that between 1,000-1,500 private jets traveled to all the surrounding airports near Davos during past WEF summits. In 2019, WEF responded to criticism, acknowledging that attendees had taken about 500 jets to the summit that year, but said attendees were \"taking the environmental impact of their travel more seriously.\"\n\n\"We have been offering incentives to participants to use public transport for some years,\" WEF said in a statement in January 2019. \"We also ask that they share planes if they have to use them; something that has been gaining popularity in recent years.\"",

The flight data broadly showed private jets traveling to the region from various cities around Europe and others from the U.S. and Asia. While the three airports — St. Gallen–Altenrhein Airport, Samedan Airport and Friedrichshafen Airport — analyzed by Fox News Digital are popular airstrips for individuals traveling to WEF summits, previous studies of private jet travel to Davos have tracked flights into four additional airports including Geneva Airport and Zurich Airport, two major international travel hubs.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSuch studies have determined that between 1,000-1,500 private jets traveled to all the surrounding airports near Davos during past WEF summits.",

            "content": "The U.S. ski team debuted new race suits at the world championships this week in an effort to bring awareness to climate change.\n\nThe blue and white suit, which depicts images of ice chunks floating across the ocean, was created in collaboration with Kappa, the team’s technical sponsor, and the nonprofit organization Protect Our Winters (POW). It appears corporate sponsors will appear across the arms and the U.S. Ski Team patch with the traditional red, white and blue will be featured on the skier’s leg.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\n\"From the initial vision and concept to the product in hand, we at U.S. Ski & Snowboard, POW and Kappa have created a suit that represents and brings attention to a warming climate,\" said U.S. Ski & Snowboard president and CEO Sophie Goldschmidt.\n\n\"Although a race suit is not solving climate change, it is a move to continue the conversation and show that U.S Ski & Snowboard and its athletes are committed to being a part of the future.\"\n\nThe POW logo will be on the neck of the suit and a snowflake logo on the leg.\n\nRUSSIAN OFFICIALS RULE 'NO FAULT' FOR FIGURE SKATER KAMILA VALIEVA IN DOPING PROBE\n\n\"POW and U.S. Ski & Snowboard are aligned on the urgency of uniting the snowsports industry and community on meaningful advocacy on climate,\" POW executive director Mario Molina said. \"This World Championships suit designed by Kappa makes a statement that athletes, brands and winter enthusiasts worldwide can get behind. By coming together, we can educate and mobilize our snowsports community to push for the clean energy technologies and policies that will most swiftly reduce emissions and protect the places we live and the lifestyles we love.\"\n\nTravis Ganong, who has been on the U.S. team since 2006, said he was \"worried\" about the lack of snow and how some of the events become limited because of it.\n\n\"I mean, it’s just kind of scary, looking at how on the limit (these events) are even to being possible anymore,\" he said. \"Places like Kitzbuehel (Austria), there’s so much history and there’s so much money involved with that event that they do whatever they can to host the event.\n\n\"But that brings up a whole other question about sustainability as well: Is that what we should be doing? ... What kind of message do we need show to the public, to the world, about how our sport is adapting to this new world we live in?\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe world championships started Monday in Meribel, France, on Feb. 19.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "title": "Republicans slam Biden DHS for starting climate change program as border crisis rages",
            "description": "The Department of Homeland Security announced a \"Climate Change Professionals Program\" this month.",
            "content": "FIRST ON FOX – Forty House Republicans are pressing the Biden administration over a new climate change program created by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) even as that agency struggles to handle the southern border crisis.\n\nRep. Brian Babin, R-Texas, a co-chairman of the House Border Security Caucus, is leading that group, which sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas Thursday.\n\nThe letter lambastes the secretary for alleged \"dereliction of duty\" for not focusing on DHS's \"intended mission by securing the border and resuming interior enforcement.\"\n\n\"Given that we had a record-breaking two million illegal crossings in 2021, we are deeply concerned that this initiative is a misuse of taxpayer dollars, a paltry attempt to distract the American people from your failure to secure the border, and a dangerous reorientation of the Department’s real job: protecting against threats to the Homeland,\" the Republicans say in their letter.\n\nOther notable members who signed the letter are Reps. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., Louis Gohmert, R-Texas, Chip Roy, R-Texas, and others.\n\nMIGRANT ENCOUNTERS INCREASED AGAIN AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER IN DECEMBER: COURT DOCS\n\nThe DHS program they are referring to is the Climate Change Professionals Program, which the department announced earlier this month. The program falls under the DHS Climate Change Action Group, which Mayorkas created last year.\n\n\"The Climate Change Professionals Program will be instrumental in helping the Department adapt to our changing climate by providing hands-on experience and guidance to young professionals interested in climate adaptation and resilience,\" Mayorkas said of the program. \"This program will develop the next generation of climate experts, improve climate literacy throughout the Department, and help us execute our Climate Action Plan to remain mission-resilient while reducing our own impacts on the environment.\"\n\nFOX FOOTAGE SHOWS MASS RELEASE OF SINGLE ADULT MIGRANTS INTO THE US\n\nThe program will last two years and those who complete it will be eligible for permanent DHS jobs. Its purpose, according to the department, will be to help DHS adapt to climate risks like floods, wildfires, droughts and other extreme weather events.\n\nBut the members who signed onto the Babin letter argue it's bogus to call climate change a \"security threat\" when \"data shows that deaths from natural disasters are at their lowest point in 120 years and that we’ve seen a 92 percent decline in the death toll from natural disasters since its peak in 1920.\"\n\n\"While we understand the frustration you and the administration must feel knowing that the American people are not buying into your preferred crisis of choice – climate change – we urge you to refocus the work of the Department to its intended mission by securing the border and resuming interior enforcement,\" the letter continues. \"Doing otherwise is a dereliction of duty, and in direct opposition to the oath of office you swore.\"\n\nBIDEN ADMIN ENROLLED FEWER THAN 300 MIGRANTS IN ‘REMAIN IN MEXICO’ IN DECEMBER\n\nAccording to the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data , there were 178,840 migrant encounters in December, up from 173,620 in November . That in turn was an increase from the 164,753 apprehensions in October.\n\nThose numbers are drastically higher than the previous year, when there were 72,113 encounters in November and 73,994 in December.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPresident Biden assigned Vice President Harris to address the root causes of illegal immigration soon after they were inaugurated. But the crisis continues to rage on with \"numerous\" migrants being released deep into the U.S., including single adults, as authorities struggle to deal with the sheer volume of border-crossers and security measures like the border wall were paused by the president.\n\nFox News' Adam Shaw and Bill Melugin contributed to this report.",

            "description": "Liberal mag mocked for knocking ‘petromasculinity’, hoping ‘climate crisis will help change masculinity’  Fox News",
            "content": "Liberal magazine The New Republic (TNR) garnered the scorn of critics after publishing an article Friday celebrating \"petromasculinity\" being rejected by younger generations, specifically those using online dating apps.\n\nIn the piece, headlined \"'Petromasculinity' Is Becoming Toxic, Too—at Least to Online Daters,\" TNR praised what appeared to be a shift in online daters preferring a potential partner who cares about climate change and \"rejecting petromasculinity: the climate denial, authoritarian politics, and sexism that are too often inextricably linked.\"\n\nINGRAHAM: WHERE HAVE ALL THE MEN GONE?\n\n\"Climate denial is not hot,\" author Liza Featherstone wrote, while citing a report from The Hill that \"climate denial\" was the biggest dealbreaker for users of the dating app OkCupid.\n\nThe report noted 90% of users said it was important a potential partner cared about the planet, although TNR noted, \"OkCupid's data isn't conducted like a formal public opinion survey and isn't representative of the population at large.\"\n\n\"This is the most committed OkCupid users have been to any issue, in the history of the company’s data collection on such subjects,\" Featherstone wrote. \"It adds to a growing body of research … showing that climate change has become central to many people’s emotional lives.\"\n\nClaiming a link between \"climate denial\" and \"hostility to feminism,\" Featherstone wrote, \"Women were more likely than men to consider climate concern a necessary quality in a mate. The fact that there’s a gender gap isn’t surprising: After all, climate denial and a certain aggressive cartoon masculinity have long been deeply intertwined.\"\n\n\"Fossil fuels have long been associated with a certain sort of red-blooded, heteronormative, nationalist masculinity,\" she added, claiming it's \"hard to ignore the sexual innuendo\" of former Alaska Governor and 2008 Republican Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin yelling, \"Drill, Baby, Drill.\"\n\nFeatherstone said that climate-conscious behaviors and habits were often associated with femininity, leading to terms like \"soy boy\" being used to describe and mock a liberal male.\n\nShe added that \"straight men's anxiety about environmentalism\" was \"a huge problem,\" and contributed to \"the culture wars surrounding climate change.\"\n\n\"But it seems a lot of online daters are rejecting this worldview. Taken alone, it would be encouraging even to learn that women of a certain demographic are done with petromasculinity and other deadly toxins,\" she wrote, before noting that climate change was also a top concern for male respondents on OkCupid.\n\n\"Of course, some men will be offended by these findings. It’s not hard to imagine certain corners of the internet igniting over the fear that not only is AOC going to take their hamburgers, but climate denialists may have more trouble getting laid. The incels aren’t going to like this,\" she added.\n\n\"But it seems possible that, among other things, our climate crisis will help change masculinity, or at least what is rewarded in men … Who wants to deal with someone too insecure to carry a reusable bag?\" the article concluded.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nCritics took to social media to mock TNR for the piece.\n\n\"Ladies, normal men are now guilty of petromasculinity,\" journalist Gabriella Hoffman joked, while also mocking TNR's admission that the data its piece was based on wasn't representative of the actual population.\n\n\"Can you imagine being single right now? My God,\" wrote businessman Marc Andreessen, while actor and journalist Ben Dreyfuss argued \"petromasculinity\" was \"not a real word.\"",

For example, now we’ve got Ukraine,\" the weatherman stated, adding, \"There’s talk about, ‘Let’s ramp up production of fossil fuels because, you know, inflation, higher gas prices.’\"\n\nHe then asked Obama, \"Do you worry that that’s gonna push back the initiative?\"\n\nObama replied with the point that the conflict between Russian and Ukraine is actually an opportunity for the United States to drop using fossil fuels altogether.\n\n\"Well, interestingly, when we see what’s happened with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it argues for us redoubling our efforts to wean ourselves off fossil fuels,\" he said.\n\n\"Russia is emboldened and empowered in part because they think we have to buy their oil and gas,\" the former president continued, but he's \"been very encouraged by … the Biden administration's ability to mobilize\" countries to \"think about how do we revamp our energy so that we are no longer dependent on these fossil fuels.\"\n\nObama stated, \"It’s not just that it is contributing to the heating of our planet, it’s also that it ends up empowering folks that we don’t want empowered.\"\n\nThe rest of the interview involved Roker and Obama speaking about how people need to be \"better caretakers\" of the planet, especially for the sake of the younger generation.\n\nOBAMA TAKES SHOT AT TRUMP OVER BIRTHER CONTROVERSY IN NBC NATIONAL PARKS SEGMENT\n\nRoker prompted the former president, saying, \"In fact, we have younger kids, Sasha and Malia, the generation that demands us being better caretakers.\"\n\nObama responded, \"I think that the generation of our kids are more mindful of how we haven’t always taken care of the planet.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",

            "description": "Bjorn Lomborg: The left should stop 'scaring our kids witless' about climate change",
            "content": "Author Bjorn Lomborg joined \"America's Newsroom\" to discuss Big Tech companies acting to help the Biden administration by stifling debate on climate change. The president of the Copenhagen Consensus Center responded Wednesday to a piece by the Wall Street Editorial Board calling out White House national climate adviser Gina McCarthy for wanting to \"censor content on the costs of a force-fed green energy transition.\"\n\nBJORN LOMBORG: Well, it seems to me that the tech companies would love to just simply say we're only saying nice, good, politically correct stuff. But of course, that's not what the tech companies and a free debate is about. It's about saying the true stories. And sometimes the true story is exactly the opposite of what the standard narrative is. Look, global warming is real, but it's not the end of the world. We should not scare our kids witless. And likewise, it's not going to be cheap. It's going to be fantastically expensive. Almost all studies show this. And we need to be honest about this. Most people are not going to put up with actually doing that. And of course, it leads to bad policies that will ultimately both fail and not deal with climate change and of course, take money away from everything else.",

Murray joined \"Fox & Friends\" on Wednesday to discuss the left's latest trend in protest of Big Oil.\n\nDOUGLAS MURRAY: They've been developing this for a while. And now here is their latest genius idea, gluing themselves to masterpieces in galleries in Britain. They started in Glasgow, ended up at the Courtauld Institute, gluing themselves to a Van Gogh painting. Now to a copy by one of Leonardo's pupils of The Last Supper. And. And every time they not only showed disdain for the works of art, they used graffiti paint to spray graffiti within centimeters of these masterworks. They unveiled a sort of horrible copy of a canvas over one of John Constable's masterpieces very, very close to damaging that work. They not only showed contempt for the works of art, which to my mind is contempt for civilization. But this incredible narcissism, this incredible narcissism, who would do this kind of thing? What kind of certainty do you have to have?\n\nWATCH THE INTERVIEW FROM \"FOX & FRIENDS\" BELOW:",

            "content": "President Biden declared on Wednesday the threat of climate change had reached \"code red for humanity,\" demanding an all-encompassing response from the White House.\n\nBiden, fresh off seeing his climate agenda rejected in Congress, pledged to utilize the full powers of the executive branch to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 50% by 2030.\n\n\"This is an emergency and I will look at it that way,\" the president said during a speech in Massachusetts. \"I'll use my executive powers to combat the climate crisis in the absence of congressional action.\"\n\nBiden said the White House was planning a series of executive actions in the coming weeks to address climate change. While the president did not elaborate directly on how expansive those actions would be, Biden touted several actions the administration is taking.\n\nDEM SENATORS CALL FOR BIDEN 'UNCHAINED' ON CLIMATE EXECUTIVE ACTION, DESPITE RECENT SUPREME COURT EPA RULING\n\nOne of those was a new $2.3 billion grant program announced Wednesday for state and local communities to build climate-resilient infrastructure. White House officials were also removing prohibitions blocking states from using federal money to set up community cooling centers to stave of extreme heat.\n\n\"It is literally – not figuratively – a clear and present danger,\" the president said when discussing climate change. \"The health of our citizens and our communities is literally at stake.\"\n\nDuring the speech, Biden made a number of gaffes. He mispronounced the name of Rep. Jake Auchincloss, D-Mass., and then asked, \"Where is she?\" In addition, he mentioned \"Glasgow, England,\" misstating the country, Scotland, where the city is actually located. And also said, \"that’s why I and so damn many other people I grew up with have cancer.\"\n\nFox News reached out to the White House for further clarification on his cancer comment.\n\nBiden also praised the advance of clean energy technology, while pledging to continue to support it with federal investment. The president warned, however, that such action would be tied to companies using union labor or providing their employees with competitive pay and benefits.\n\n\"We're going to build a different future,\" he said. \"One with green energy and good paying jobs.\"\n\nThe speech came after negotiations stalled once again in Congress on including green energy subsidies in a party-line spending bill. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., recently urged his party to delay including tax and climate change provisions within the package until there was a clear picture of the national economy.\n\nWithout Manchin's support, the tax is unlikely to become law. That is because Democrats can only pass the legislation within the 50-50 Senate via a party-line process known as budget reconciliation.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe setback has left Democrats demanding Biden utilize the full powers of the presidency to address climate change unilaterally.\n\n\"We have a president who campaigned on climate, who has been chained to the legislative process, thinking about his past as a senator,\" said Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore. \"Now he's unchained, and he has to go.",

            "content": "Wisconsin Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, the state's Democratic candidate for Senate, chaired a government climate change task force that recommended anti-racism education.\n\nThe so-called Task Force on Climate Change — which Gov. Tony Evers, D-Wis., created and appointed Barnes to lead in October 2019 — was designed to develop strategies for the state's government to pursue to combat climate change. Barnes and the task force's other members delivered a final report more than a year later in December 2020 which laid out 55 solutions to fight global warming and promote \"environmental justice.\"\n\n\"In order to address this crisis and the environmental injustices associated with it, we must take urgent action, and we must ensure those actions are equitable and inclusive—anything less will continue the long pattern of environmental racism we have witnessed in this country,\" Barnes said in a statement after the report was published.\n\nAmong its policy recommendations, the task force recommended implementing an anti-racism education curriculum across government entities through executive action and legislation. The task force asserted that racism was linked to climate change.\n\nWISCONSIN DEM SENATE CANDIDATE SPENT NEARLY $600K ON POLICE DETAIL WHILE COZYING UP TO DEFUND POLICE MOVEMENT\n\n\"Environmental racism and climate change are inextricably linked because the embedded racism and bias that exist within social, government, corporate, and financial systems deem who benefits from activities that produce harmful emissions and who suffers most from the consequences,\" the report stated.\n\n\"Historically, communities of color and low-income communities have suffered the most.\"\n\nThe report added that \"systemic racism remains embedded in our social structures\" and the average American’s historical and racial literacy is \"depressingly low.\" It also suggested using unconscious bias education to prevent future unjust laws.\n\nIn addition, the task force suggested the state government should expand support for adding climate science to its K-12 public school curriculum.\n\n\"In order to achieve environmental justice in Wisconsin, government bodies—along with others including corporations, nonprofit organizations, foundations, financial institutions, and the education system—must confront the racism and bias that exist within their systems,\" the report stated.\n\nOther recommendations included creating an Office of Environmental Justice, mandating a racial disparity impact study and launching climate change \"education campaign.\" The report noted that proposals to divest from fossil fuel investments and ban future oil and gas projects were discussed but not finalized.\n\nBarnes, meanwhile, has previously defended critical race theory (CRT), arguing that religious education was more akin to \"indoctrination.\"\n\n\"Many of the same people rallying against critical race theory on the basis of 'indoctrination' are totally cool with tax dollars going towards religious education,\" he tweeted on June 23, 2021. \"Make it make sense.\"\n\nCRT refers to a school of thought that broadly aims to study how racism impacts major societal institutions. Local school districts nationwide have faced heavy criticism over the last year for introducing CRT concepts into K-12 curricula.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBarnes is running to oust incumbent Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., in the upcoming November midterm election. The race is rated as a \"toss up\" by Cook Political Report and a recent Fox News poll showed Barnes with a slight lead over Johnson.\n\nBarnes' campaign didn't respond to a request for comment.",

            "content": "FIRST ON FOX: on the White House for using the anniversaries of the two most damaging hurricanes in state history to \"push their radical Green New Deal.\"\n\nAugust 29 marked the anniversaries of making landfall in the Pelican State, each storm the most destructive and second most destructive hurricanes in state history, respectively.\n\nIn response to a tweet recognizing the anniversary of the two storms, White House regional communications director Dhara Nayyar said hurricanes and other natural disasters are a \"reminder\" of the \"climate crisis.\"\n\n\"As [Biden] knows, hurricanes, flooding and wildfires serve as a reminder that ‘the climate crisis is here,\" Nayyar tweeted on the anniversaries of Hurricanes Katrina and Ida.\n\n\"That's why he announced executive actions to combat this emergency and protect communities from the impacts already at hand,\" she continued.\n\nLouisiana Republicans had choice words for the administration over the tweet, with House Minority Whip Steve Scalise torching the White House over the tweet in a statement to Fox News Digital.\n\n\"On the anniversary of tragedies like Hurricane Katrina that took the lives of more than a thousand people, due primarily to the failure of federal levees, the White House should be more focused on fulfilling their commitment to our communities rather than using the anniversary of a tragedy to push their radical Green New Deal agenda that is crushing families by raising energy costs on hardworking taxpayers,\" Scalise said.\n\n\"Our communities include hardworking, resilient people who have weathered storms and other adversity for generations, and they will always come back stronger,\" the number two House Republican said. \"President Biden’s actions have made gas prices for Louisiana families higher, while decimating the energy industry in the cleanest-producing county in the world, all while begging Russia, Iran, and Saudi Arabia to produce more carbon-intensive energy that costs us more at the pump and on our utility bills.\"\n\nRep. Clay Higgins, Scalise’s fellow Louisiana Republican, told Fox News Digital that everything \"the Biden administration does is agenda driven.\"\n\n\"It is no surprise to see Biden officials use the anniversary of hurricanes to push their Green New Deal agenda,\" Higgins said on Tuesday. \"Historically, the Louisiana delegation has always battled to deliver disaster recovery funding for South Louisiana, and I support focused, financially-responsible investments in flood and storm mitigation.\"\n\n\"Hurricanes are a part of life in South Louisiana. My office also supports an all-of-the-above energy policy,\" he continued. \"However, I 100% oppose Biden’s weaponization of the federal government to mandate and tax the oil and gas industry out of existence.\"\n\nWhen asked for comment on the criticism, White House spokesperson Andrew Bates pointed to previous Fox News reporting \"based on a NOAA report during the Trump Administration, ‘Hurricanes are reportedly strengthening as the Earth's climate grows warmer.’\"\n\n\"And like Senator Cassidy said regarding the climate resilience funding we worked together to include in the bipartisan infrastructure law, ‘2020 set a record nationally for the most named storms in a single season’ and ‘Hurricane Ida gave us a harsh reminder that we need to strengthen the infrastructure that protects us from the worst of these,'\" Bates said.\n\n\"We are committed to overcoming the unprecedented national security and economic threat of climate change, building a stronger, more competitive economy and creating millions of new jobs in the process,\" he continued. \"We encourage Rep. Scalise to work with us in that effort, instead of voting to defund the police by gutting the COPS program.\"\n\nMitch Landrieu, a White House senior adviser, also weighed in online, writing the \"climate crisis has increased the frequency and intensity of storms, creating economic [and] national security risks.\"\n\n\"We must build more resilient infrastructure-physical [and] natural,\" Landrieu continued. \"Luckily, [Biden] brought together Dems [and] Republicans to pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.\"\n\nIn the wake of Hurricane Ida, lawmakers from Louisiana such as Republican Senator Bill Cassidy called for federal assistance in storm recovery, as tends to be the case.\n\nRepublican Louisiana Rep. Garret Graves, a leader in the Hurricane Katrina recovery, said in 2019 that the GOP and Democrats need to come together on solutions to help local communities prepare for environmental changes.\n\n\"There is built-up momentum in the atmosphere right now where adaptation is the thing you’ve got to do no matter what, right out of the gate,\" Graves said.\n\n2020 also saw a record number of 30 named hurricanes with five of them hitting Louisiana.\n\n2005’s Hurricane Katrina is a notorious name in American history as the most destructive natural disaster in U.S. history.\n\nThe majority of Katrina’s damage came from the torrents of flooding, most notably in New Orleans where several levees broke, allowing water to rush into the city below sea level.\n\nThe flooding , destroying New Orleans. Additionally, 80 percent of the 1,464 deaths caused by Katrina came from New Orleans.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOn the fiscal side, Katrina was estimated to have caused $96 billion dollars in damage. Meanwhile, it is estimated 2021’s Hurricane Ida may exceed $95 billion, placing it as the the start of the millennium.\n\nIda’s cost was initially estimated to be between $70 billion and $80 billion. The 2021 storm also killed 87 Americans out of the 107 killed by the storm.",

            "description": "Democrats blaming climate change for Hurricane Ian at odds with science, experts say",
            "content": "Multiple experts contacted by Fox News Digital argued that there isn't sufficient evidence to suggest climate change caused Hurricane Ian or any individual natural disaster.\n\nThe experts' comments come as a series of media outlets, Democrats and progressive commentators continue to blame the hurricane on human-caused global warming. Hurricane Ian slammed into southwest Florida as a Category 4 storm on Wednesday, causing more than a million residents to lose power and prompting stark safety warnings from Florida officials.\n\n\"What they're trying to do is politicize the pain and suffering of these people to promote their green agenda,\" Gregory Wrightstone, the executive director of the climate policy think tank CO2 Coalition, told Fox News Digital in an interview. \"Well, their policies and their agenda to promote renewables will do far greater economic destruction to the country and Florida.\"\n\nOver the last several days, media outlets, including the New York Times, Associated Press, Politico, NPR and Axios, have published news stories reporting that climate change is to blame for Hurricane Ian and the storm's rapid intensification. A Time magazine article said the \"science is well known\" that climate change created the conditions for Hurricane Ian.\n\nNASA: VIDEO OF HURRICANE IAN CAPTURED FROM SPACE STATION AS IT HITS FLORIDA\n\nIn addition, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., appeared to suggest that Americans need to vote for Democrats to avoid future hurricanes during an interview Tuesday. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., tweeted Thursday that \"the rapid storm intensification we're seeing with Hurricane Ian will become more common and more dangerous\" as the climate changes.\n\nAnd a series of progressive commentators and climate activists took to social media to similarly peg the hurricane on global warming.\n\nMIDTERM CANDIDATES RUNNING RACES IN HURRICANE IAN'S PATH REACT TO THE DISASTROUS STORM\n\n\"Ian is a climate change hurricane,\" Pam Keith, a former Democratic Senate candidate and founder of left-wing firm Center for Employment Justice, tweeted Wednesday.\n\n\"[Hurricane Ian] is a textbook example of climate change impacting people,\" Nina Turner, a senior fellow at progressive think tank Institute on Race, Power and Political Economy, added. \"Climate change isn’t political, it’s reality.\"\n\nHowever, Wrightstone and the other experts contacted by Fox News Digital rejected those arguments, arguing that individual storms cannot be linked to climate change.\n\n\"If you read what [the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)] says on hurricanes, there's just not enough data,\" Steve Milloy, a senior legal fellow at the Energy & Environment Legal Institute, told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"There's nothing to back up what they're saying is,\" he continued. \"There were about 16 major hurricanes between 1916 and 1965 but only six since 1965. So, clearly major hurricanes happen with lower levels of carbon dioxide. That doesn't add up for them.\"\n\nBIDEN SUGGESTS AMERICANS NOT PROUD OF US IN DIVISIVE FUNDRAISER SPEECH AS FLORIDA PUMMELED BY HURRICANE IAN\n\nA NOAA study last revised in July concluded that its models and analysis didn't support the notion that greenhouse gas-induced warming leads to large increases in either tropical storm or overall hurricane numbers in the Atlantic. The study, authored by senior NOAA scientist Tom Knutson, added that it was \"premature to conclude with high confidence\" that human-caused increasing greenhouse gases have had any impact on hurricane activity in the Atlantic.\n\nJamie Rhome, the acting director of NOAA's National Hurricane Center, echoed the study's findings in an interview with CNN on Tuesday, pushing back against anchor Don Lemon's argument that Hurricane Ian's intensification is tied to climate change. Rhome said he \"would caution against\" linking any one storm to climate change.\n\n\"Trying to blame global warming for Hurricane Ian not only defies scientific evidence — the clear weight of scientific evidence — but it is a despicable politicization of a real tragedy that requires our attention and focus on the people negatively affected,\" James Taylor, the president of conservative think tank Heartland Institute, said in an interview with Fox News Digital.\n\n\"These types of hurricanes existed before SUVs and coal-fired power plants were invented,\" Taylor added. \"In fact, they were much more frequent and severe before coal power plants and SUVs.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWrightstone, who also serves as an expert reviewer for the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), added that the number of hurricanes this year has actually been lower than previous years.\n\n\"The IPCC sees no correlation between warming temperatures and more hurricanes,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"And we saw that this year. Up until this hurricane, which is massive, it had been almost historically low numbers of hurricanes.\"",

            "title": "White House to study releasing aerosols into the atmosphere to counter climate change",
            "description": "The White House is orchestrating a five-year-plan on how to counter climate change that will explore how spraying aerosols into the stratosphere can lower temperatures.",
            "content": "The White House plans to study spraying aerosols such as sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere to counter climate change — a strategy some scientists view as a risky intervention in the atmosphere but that others think may be a useful last resort to prevent global warming.\n\nThis practice, called geoengineering, aims to reflect the sun’s radiation from the stratosphere back into space to minimize rising temperatures. The White House five-year plan was authorized by Congress this year and is being executed by the Office of Science and Technology Policy and the Department of Energy.\n\nResearchers are split on whether the risks of geoengineering outweigh the rewards, mostly due to a lack of information on the subject.\n\nBIDEN'S ENERGY SECRETARY TOOK MEETING WITH BILL GATES IMMEDIATELY AFTER SENATE CONFIRMATION\n\nDaniel Cohan, associate professor for civil and environmental engineering at Rice University, said there are more natural, safe and impactful ways to counter climate change than geoengineering. But he added that additional studies on the topic can reveal the exact magnitude of its cooling benefits and climate risks.\n\n\"It seems likely that these techniques could be developed to offset much of the warming that is expected in the decades ahead,\" Cohan told Fox News Digital. \"But how it would affect regional weather patterns is highly uncertain, and that’s likely where there would be huge winners and losers.\"\n\nThis form of geoengineering involves aircraft releasing aerosols in the atmosphere where they can partially reflect the sun’s radiation. The White House project will not include flying planes but instead study potential impacts. The hypothesis has its roots in documented instances of volcanic eruptions leading to notable decreases in temperatures in the surrounding area.\n\nHarvard professor David Keith said there is a growing case for research efforts that explore the exact impact of geoengineering.\n\n\"Use of geoengineering will never be ‘necessary ’— it’s a hard choice one on which people will have divergent views,\" Keith told Fox News Digital. \"My hope is that the U.S. government comes out with a transparent, high-quality research plan that can advance knowledge in the public interest.\"\n\nDiana Furchtgott-Roth, the director of the Center on Energy, Climate, and Environment at the Heritage Foundation, said she is in full support of the White House’s research because an effective geoengineering model would be far more affordable than current efforts to counter climate change such as environmental regulations and renewable energy.\n\n\"This has potentially very large benefits with a much smaller cost,\" Furchtgott-Roth told Fox News Digital.\n\nUS PROPOSES MEASURES TO LIMIT METHANE LEAKS CAUSED BY OIL DRILLING\n\nThe downside of geoengineering, several experts note, is that the released aerosols only impact a limited area and must be renewed at a rapid pace to continue a reflection of the sun. Potential risks included unintentionally cooling farms that need the sun to grow crops, as well as intensified storms. Benji Backer, the president of the American Conservative Coalition, said the Biden administration is better off focusing on more environmentally friendly policies.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"One of the worst ways to mess with a change in our weather is by trying to create more changes in the weather,\" Backer told Fox News Digital. \"The climate change dilemma certainly requires solutions that improve our air quality and overall level of pollution, but what we don't need is over-corrective research that attempts to play the hand of God.\"",

The hypothesis has its roots in documented instances of volcanic eruptions leading to notable decreases in temperatures in the surrounding area.\n\nHarvard professor David Keith said there is a growing case for research efforts that explore the exact impact of geoengineering.\n\n\"Use of geoengineering will never be ‘necessary ’ \n\n\"One of the worst ways to mess with a change in our weather is by trying to create more changes in the weather,\" Backer told Fox News Digital.",

            "content": "Incoming House Democratic Whip Katherine Clark of Massachusetts on Sunday recalled one of her children \"waking up with nightmares\" due to concerns about climate change.\n\nClark made the comment when asked by NBC News anchor Chuck Todd what she and incoming House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries intended to do differently than their leadership predecessors, Reps. Nancy Pelosi and Steny Hoyer.\n\nThe 59-year-old Clark argued that her \"generation\" could bring a fresh perspective to Congress because her kids grew up being tormented by the threats of climate change and gun violence.\n\nJEFFRIES SAYS BIDEN PRESIDENCY HAS ‘EXTRAORDINARY RECORD,’ LOOKS FORWARD TO SUPPORTING REELECTION IN 2024\n\n\"One of the biggest changes is going to be that we're coming into this in the minority, but the commitment that we have had to the people of this country, to workers, to women, to the climate is going to continue on,\" Clark said.\n\n\"And let me tell you what it means to me coming in as a different generation,\" she continued. \"I remember my middle child waking up with nightmares over concern around climate change. I've had my family at a movie theater, when the movie stopped, my children immediately felt there must be a shooter in the theater with us.\"\n\n\"These are the type of experiences that we are going to bring as we continue to push to meet this moment of challenge for the American people with progress,\" she added.\n\nA clip of Clark's comment received mockery on Twitter with GOP consultant Michael Duncan tweeting, \"would snitch to CPS if someone told me this,\" referring to child protective services.\n\nFormer Trump White House senior adviser Stephen Miller responded to the tweet by saying, \"The only way this could happen to a child is if the parents made it so.\"\n\n\n\n CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nJeffries, D-N.Y., has been elected as minority leader, Clark as minority whip and Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., as caucus chair after Pelosi, Hoyer and Majority Whip James Clyburn announced they’re turning over the reins.\n\nMinority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., who was nominated as speaker by House Republicans last month, hopes he can eke out a win when the entire House votes in January. He can't lose more than four Republican votes, and at least five Republicans have spoken out that they will not support him for speaker.",

            "description": "A new climate change documentary centering on Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. performed poorly at the box office despite the film's glowing critic reception.",
            "content": "New York Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s new climate change documentary debuted in movie theaters over the weekend, generating an abysmal $80 per theater.\n\nThe new film, \"To the End,\" was filmed over four years and follows four young women, Cortez, activist Varshini Prakash, climate policy writer Rhiana Gunn-Wright, and political strategist Alexandra Rojas, as they attempt to pass sweeping climate change legislation in Congress.\n\nThe film currently boasts an 88% \"fresh\" critic score on Rotten Tomatoes and does not yet have an audience score.\n\nAOC, CORI BUSH ANGER FELLOW SOCIALISTS BY VOTING YES ON RAILROAD WORKER DEAL\n\n\"Representative Ocasio-Cortez offers the best onscreen antidote to despair — she’s funny, a canny political strategy,\" Teo Bugbee of The New York Times wrote.\n\n\"To the End is set to ignite more Americans to take action,\" RogertEbert.com’s Nick Allen wrote in his review.\n\nThe documentary debuted on over 120 screens over the weekend but garnered less than $10,000 dollars across all theaters, coming in 33rd place overall for box office.\n\nSeveral Oscar-bait films lauded during film festivals have struggled to excel in theaters this year, with critics attributing the audience drop off to the rise in streaming platforms, audiences’ increasing distrust in critic scores, and topics that do not interest a large swathe of the public.\n\nThe latter factor may have been the largest contributor to the film’s meager earnings, with climate change documentaries in the last several years failing to draw in a substantial audience.\n\nNEW YORK REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ UNDER INVESTIGATION BY HOUSE ETHICS COMMITTEE\n\nEarlier this year, \"The Territory,\" a National Geographic film about indigenous people fighting effects of climate change, earned less than $70,000 throughout its entire run in theaters.\n\nRachel Lears and Robin Blotnick, the creators of \"To the End,\" previously made \"Knock Down the House,\" which revolved around the 2018 congressional primary campaigns of Cortez, Amy Vilela, Cori Bush, Paula Jean Swearengin, and four other progressive Democrats.\n\nWhile the documentary \"Knock Down the House\" garnered praise from movie critics, certified with a 99% on Rotten Tomatoes, the public had a very different opinion on the project, with a score sitting at 11%.\n\nOne audience member called the film a \"knocked down drag out snooze fest,\" while others knocked the film for its \"extremely polarizing message.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I feel like I must have watched a completely different movie than the ones [the critics] watched,\" one viewer said. \"It was absolutely terrible, and it actually made me dislike Alexandria Cortez after it was all over. I now see the audience score and I would say it is much more accurate compared to the critics.\"\n\nIn 2020, a seven-minute film on The Green New Deal, narrated by Ocasio-Cortez and illustrated by Molly Crabapple, was nominated for an Emmy.",

            "content": "The Biden administration on Tuesday released a list of key topics for discussion at the North American Leaders Summit in Mexico City with Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n\nThe White House said that trilateral cooperation will help North America better address shared challenges like \"climate change, the COVID-19 pandemic, and transnational criminal organizations trafficking and smuggling people and illicit drugs like fentanyl.\"\n\nThe proposals also aim to deepen economic cooperation and develop a better understanding of \"unmet needs,\" particularly with badly needed semiconductor supply chains in the region.\n\nAmong the other proposals discussed are the need to balance \"public narratives on migrants and refugees\" to combat \"xenophobia\" and \"discrimination.\"\n\nTEXAS DEMS ACCUSED OF TREATING BIDEN'S BORDER VISIT AS ‘PHOTO OP’ SILENT ON CITY CLEANING UP BEFORE THE TRIP\n\nThese are included in the broader topic of achieving \"humane migration\" in the region. These steps including building on past initiatives to give migrants the information they need to come to the U.S., measures that seek to speed up the asylum-seeking process for \"eligible\" individuals while quickly removing those with \"unmeritorious protection claims.\" The leaders will also discuss coordinating actions to combat arms and drug trafficking and human smuggling.\n\nBuilding on this, the three leaders will also discuss their commitment to combat racism by promoting \"diverse, inclusive, equitable, and democratic societies.\"\n\nAmbitious climate goals will also be discussed, such as installing electric vehicle chargers along international borders \"to ensure a seamless EV charging transition from country to country.\"\n\nThe White House said the leaders will also discuss sharing information between their respective countries on ways to best electrify and decarbonize public buses through the cooperative development of a Joint Transit Decarbonization Toolkit.\n\nIn December, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) revealed that since the start of fiscal year 2023, which began in October, more than 485,000 migrants crossed the southern border and was expected to hit half a million later in the month.\n\nDespite the constant wave of migrants passing through the border the past few months, the number of illegal migrant crossings into the U.S. has reportedly dropped significantly since December, CBP sources previously confirmed to Fox News Digital.\n\nThe three-way gathering is held most years, although there was a hiatus while Donald Trump was U.S. president. It's often called the \"three amigos summit,\" a reference to the deep diplomatic and economic ties among the countries.\n\nHowever, the leaders have found themselves at odds, especially as they struggle to handle an influx of migrants and to crack down on smugglers.\n\nThe key takeaways from the summit revolve around better connections among the three nations and a shared goal of a stronger North America on energy and in particular semiconductors, climate and a pledge to cut methane emissions, an agreement to manage large waves of migrants coming to the region and a more cohesive regional strategy on dealing with future pandemic-related health threats.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFox News Digital has reached out to the White House for additional comment.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "description": "The Nation offered a defense for evacuating the city of Miami on Friday to begin preparing the United States for incoming climate migration and prevent \"racial apartheid.\"",
            "content": "Daniel Aldana Cohen and Samantha Schuyler provided arguments regarding the question \"Should We Start Preparing for the Evacuation of Miami?\" in a piece for The Nation on Friday.\n\nCohen, a UC Berkeley sociology professor, offered the main argument in support of evacuating the major Florida city to both help Floridians and \"force municipalities across the United States to get serious about hosting climate migrants in egalitarian ways.\"\n\n\"It’s urgent for governments and social movements to start planning for millions of people to land in new places. Prepping Miami’s evacuation is a perfect starting point. Its residents are a multiracial, multinational, and multigenerational assemblage that spans the class spectrum. Tragically, many of them are already climate migrants—like Puerto Ricans displaced by recent hurricanes,\" Cohen said.\n\nHe continued, \"If cities around the country were forced to plan how they’d integrate arriving Miamians into communities flush with public green investment, they’d get a head start on planning for climate migration generally. This would also trigger conversations about zoning for density, enshrining tenant rights, upgrading infrastructure, taxing the rich, building green banks, and battling racism and police violence.\"\n\nCohen further criticized the U.S. for taking part in what he referred to as \"racial violence\" for failing to properly relocate citizens.\n\n\"And yet, right now, the U.S. doesn’t have a just—or even functional—policy for immigrants and refugees. It’s still struggling to support Indigenous communities facing displacement from environmental calamities caused by colonial settlers. And the US has handled domestic movements for freedom terribly. In the last century, the emancipatory promise of the Great Migration was savagely curtailed by segregation and mass incarceration. Leading sociologists and scholars of environmental injustice called this racial violence a form of apartheid. Today, a surge in climate displacement threatens to deepen this eco-apartheid,\" Cohen wrote.\n\nAlthough Schuyler, The Nation’s research director, argued against evacuating Miami, she instead argued to further adapt coastal cities to prepare for climate disasters.\n\n\"Shortsighted, surface-level adaptations aren’t going to save metropolises like Miami; we need to reimagine coastal living. The United Nations estimates that over 1 billion people live in low-lying cities vulnerable to coast-specific climate hazards,\" Schuyler wrote. \"Miami, therefore, has a lot of work to do. So far, the metro area’s attempts at resiliency have been green-lighted and financed in such a halting, disjointed, and uncoordinated way that they have resulted in a faulty patchwork of projects.\"\n\nShe also conceded, \"At some point, if South Florida doesn’t change its approach to navigating climate change, evacuation will be necessary. But by withdrawing from Miami too soon, we will lose a vibrant city that could have become a training ground for learning how to adapt to the planet’s future. It’s not just South Florida that is facing climate catastrophe; it’s Los Angeles, New York City, Mumbai, and many other places. Tremendous human effort created Miami, and if we act soon, that kind of effort can save it too—and show the world how it’s done.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAs recently as October, mainstream media touted climate change as a threat to Florida, particularly after the state faced Hurricane Ian. Fox News Digital recounted more than 600 uses of the phrase \"climate change\" between the one-week period of Sept. 26 and Oct. 2.",

Although Schuyler, The Nation’s research director, argued against evacuating Miami, she instead argued to further adapt coastal cities to prepare for climate disasters. It’s not just South Florida that is facing climate catastrophe; it’s Los Angeles, New York City, Mumbai, and many other places.",

            "content": "United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres issued a stark warning on climate change, warning the \"time bomb is ticking\" on the heels of a new climate report.\n\nThe United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published its \"synthesis report\" Monday detailing the impact humanity has had on climate change and what needs to be done to counter the shift.\n\n\"Humanity is on thin ice, and the ice is melting fast,\" Guterres said during a recorded address. \"Humans are responsible for virtually all global heating over the last 200 years. The rate of temperature rising in the last half century is the highest in 2,000 years.\"\n\nUN CALLS FOR SCIENTIST TO SERVE ‘COLD, HARD FACTS’ THAT WILL PUSH GOVERNMENTS TO CURB CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n\"Concentrations of carbon dioxide are at their highest in at least two million years,\" he continued. \"The climate time bomb is ticking.\"\n\nHe detailed how the world would need to endure a \"quantum leap in climate action\" to reverse course, but argued it is possible if all countries are aligned socially and economically to mitigate the trend.\n\nDeveloped countries should cease utilizing fossil fuel energy sources sooner rather than later, he warned, urging them to reach no net emissions by 2040.\n\nA series of international scientists worked on the IPCC report, which was analyzed base on years of comprehensive research. Gutterres called the report, which serves as a baseline for policymakers, a \"survival guide for humanity.\"\n\nThe IPCC's findings, detailed in the 37-page report, serve as the foundation for climate negotiations in the Paris Climate Accord.\n\nThe report found that greenhouse gas emissions have increased courtesy of \"unsustainable energy use, land use and land-use change, lifestyles, and patterns of consumption and production.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe data indicated that in order for the world to halt surpassing the targeted warming limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit), the globe must reduce emissions in half.\n\nAnd if emissions are not reduced significantly, the warming limit will surpass the 1.5 degree Celsius goal in the coming years, potentially by 2035.\n\nPresident Biden echoed Guterres' sentiment on the limit earlier this month during a sit down interview on \"The Daily Show.\"\n\n\"If we don't keep the temperature from going above 1.5 degrees Celsius, raised, then we're in real trouble,\" he said. \"That whole generation is damned. That’s not hyperbole. Really truly in trouble.\"\n\nBiden warned the climate crisis remains a larger threat than nuclear warfare during a Democratic National Committee fundraiser in January.",

            "content": "EXCLUSIVE – Sixteen Republican attorneys general on Tuesday accused the U.S. Treasury, Federal Reserve, FDIC and Comptroller of the Currency for contributing to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) by prioritizing President Biden’s climate agenda over sound banking practices.\n\n\"To put it bluntly, the administration’s zealotry in fighting climate change by unwisely — and illegally — attempting to convert federal financial regulators into environmental activists is inextricably intertwined with these bank failures and the fallout from them,\" they wrote.\n\n\"Your warping of the financial regulatory system undermines both the safe and sound operation of financial institutions and the public’s faith in the fairness and efficacy of the regulatory regime,\" they added. \"We urge you to change course and refocus your efforts on managing actual financial risk.\"\n\nUtah Attorney General Sean Reyes and 15 of his colleagues sent a letter Tuesday to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Martin Gruenberg, and acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu following the collapse of SVB this month after suffering $1.8 billion in losses due to bond investments that tanked as interest rates rose. When SVB's share price crashed 60%, the FDIC stepped to take over the bank's operations as depositors panicked and rushed to withdraw their money.\n\nHOW BIG TECH, THE FEDS AND THE MEDIA ALL FAILED ON SILICON VALLEY BANK\n\nThe AGs detailed the Biden administration's directive to banks to give climate-related risks special treatment and to downplay investment in traditional energy infrastructure, factors that they say led to the demise of SVB and possible other financial institutions in the future.\n\n\"SVB’s failure is a warning sign that the administration’s environmental activism in its financial regulation not only ignores real financial risk but increases it,\" Attorney General Reyes told Fox News Digital in a statement. \"The administration should refocus regulation on true risk and stop pressuring financial institutions to meet impossible net-zero targets.\"\n\n\"Before more damage is done, we urge you to turn away from the politicized path and refocus the regulatory agencies on true risk management,\" the AGs wrote in their letter.\n\nHOW FIRST REPUBLIC RESCUE, SILICON VALLEY BANK COULD COST MAIN STREET AMERICA\n\nThe AGs charged that the federal leaders’ \"lack of focus on true systemic and prudential risk issues creates concern about the health of the financial system in general, as investors have fled bank stocks in recent days.\"\n\n\"If this continues, the financial position of banks will further erode, which weakens the financial system,\" the AGs said.\n\nSILICON VALLEY BANK COMMITTED ‘ONE OF THE MOST ELEMENTARY ERRORS IN BANKING,’ LARRY SUMMERS SAYS\n\n\"Banks may be forced to raise additional capital, which may further the perception that the financial system is weak and could ultimately result in a feedback loop of increasing concern that causes real harm to all Americans. This would be the poisoned fruit of your politicization of the financial regulatory function,\" they wrote.\n\nThe state top cops warned that federal regulators should \"publicly direct banks to pursue profitability, liquidity, and prudent risk management, and note that declining to serve customers for failing to comply with unrealistic climate initiatives like achieving net zero by 2050 is a threat to the financial system.\"\n\n\"You should make clear that no agency, nor any agency personnel, have authority to pressure any bank to increase its exposure of net-zero compliant customers or to decline to do business with companies for not being net-zero compliant,\" they wrote.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"You should also direct banks to stop setting emissions reductions targets that are inherently arbitrary and undermine public confidence in the financial system,\" they wrote.",

            "description": "Fox News host Greg Gutfeld blasted the latest report by the U.N. panel on climate change for its \"fear mongering\" and \"subtle caveat that contradicts the whole report\" on \"Gutfeld!\"",
            "content": "Happy Wednesday, everyone, especially since we don't have many Wednesdays left. Yeah, it's that time again, the end is nigh all hope is lost. No, Steve Doocy didn't get his own show, although Bill Hemmer found out I've been stealing his running shorts from the break room. But forget about inflation or our increasingly bellicose adversaries. Pay no mind to fentanyl, the rising crime rate or drag queen story hour. That was a mistake.\n\nI'm talking about Mother Nature, and, boy, it's become a mother. Of course, this real threat to humanity, it's never really gone away. Its delivery day just keeps getting changed. The New York Times delivers this ominous warning, Climate Change is Speeding toward Catastrophe, the Next Decade is Crucial, the U.N. panel says. \"Earth is likely to cross a critical threshold for global warming within the next decade and nations will need to make an immediate and drastic shift away from fossil fuels to prevent the planet from overheating dangerously beyond that level, according to a major new report released on Monday.\" A new report, right? Huh? It eerily sounds like the same one Al Gore and the rest of these lying, fear mongering ---- have been screaming at us for the last 40 years. Yeah!\n\nCALIFORNIA GOV. NEWSOM STRIKES DEAL TO PUNISH FOSSIL FUEL COMPANIES AFTER FIRST PROPOSAL REJECTED\n\nHey, but so what? Right? You peasants need to suffer, or the whole world will be doomed. Except that the Times drops this not so subtle caveat that contradicts the whole report. \"Many scientists have,\" you know they \"pointed out that surpassing the 1.5 degree threshold will not mean humanity is doomed.\" Wait a second, so, wait, we're not doomed? Holly ----. Why didn't you just say so to begin with? Now, I'm sure that this so-called threshold is arbitrary, just the thing every fear merchant can agree on. It's funny, though, the headline screams catastrophe, but then halfway through it, they say never mind.\n\nThe shocking news isn't so shocking at all. Imagine if that's how I called 911, huh? Hello? Everyone's going to die. Why? My fan broke. What a bunch of shock blockers. Anyway, it's not as if there was ever any climate change before we all decided we were killing the planet. It's not like 12,000 years ago there was a giant glacier right where I'm sitting, but no one blamed that on one of my many yachts. But we've been down this road before, like, every few years, like, for my entire life, and I'm 85 years old. I know I look great, it's all about hydration and a healthy sex life. Isn't that right, Melinda?\n\nBut these experts keep moving the goalposts because they're worse at predicting the end of the world than the Mayans. 2012 was the last time I donated to charity because I thought the world was ending. What's the point, huh? Kids are going to die. They pick the year everything ends, and then that deadline passes. Then, coincidentally, Greta Thunberg deletes her tweet about it and the climate crooks have to pick a new date, and then they start fending for their doomsday fix once again. They say the sky is falling when the only thing falling is this guy on the stairs of Air Force One. Terrible, but how often are we to keep hearing this.\n\nGRETA THUNBERG TELLS 'VIEW' HOSTS THAT CLIMATE ACTIVISTS MUST NOW GO BEYOND 'LEGAL METHODS'\n\nALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ 2019: The world is going to end in 12 years if we don't address climate change?\n\nYeah, right. If that's true, why are you in such great shape? I mean, if the world's ending, there's no need for a beach body. Hell, I'd blow up like Brian Stelter and die in a bed made of chocolate éclairs. But imagine if it wasn't climate ideology being pushed, but something just as fallible like a Ponzi scheme, but we were forced to treat it with this solemn respect: Oh, look, the Bernie Madoff Institute for Financial Wisdom has just released its latest findings and yes, you need to give more money to the Bernie Madoff Institute for Financial Wisdom. That's climate activism. Bottom line, you can never trust an addict, even a climate change one. The apocalypse is always around the corner, then we turn that corner and nothing. So then it's the next corner, and the next, they got more corners than a haunted corn maze. And why?\n\nBecause it's incentivized. You do this grift, the world opens up to you. You don't get adulation if you speak soberly on crime or nuclear energy. Climate's different, though. Greta Thunberg is getting an honorary doctorate, even though she's literally famous for skipping school. She's like Ferris Bueller, but without the misfortune of marrying Sarah Jessica Parker. But that's an incentive not just for attention starved kids, but for attention starved adults as well. The former teen will receive the award from the Faculty of Theology at the University of Helsinki. She's the first one to hold the title of doctor while also needing one. But theology?\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nNow if I remember my Greek, and I remember a lot of Greeks, that's from the word Theo, which means Dr. Cliff Huxtables' only son. Wait, no, Theo means God. It's the study of Gods. I wonder how many times my name comes up in the textbooks, right? I mean, that, I guess that means they're finally admitting climate change is truly a religion, and it is, just like Jonestown.",

            "description": "ABC's Stephanpoulos spars with Chris Christie over energy independence: Climate change is 'existential crisis'  Fox News",
            "content": "ABC's George Stephanopoulos said that climate change was an \"existential crisis\" during an exchange with former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie about domestic oil production amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Sunday's \"This Week.\"\n\nAmid a discussion about the possibility of the U.S. banning Russian oil, Stephanopoulos asked Christie if the Republicans would \"forgo criticizing\" President Biden for increased gas prices if he makes the decision.\n\n\"You have to do two things at the same time, and you should be able to. You have to ban Russian oil, and you have to increase domestic production. And that is where Joe Biden is going to have the problem because he's held captive by the environmental left,\" Christie said.\n\nThe former New Jersey governor noted comments from John Kerry in which he said the war could have \"profound negative impact on the climate.\" The Biden administration climate envoy added he hopes Russian President Vladimir Putin \"will help us stay on track with respect to what we need to do for the climate.\"\n\n\"That will summarize what the far left's view is about domestic oil production,\" Christie said.\n\nStephanopoulos quickly shot back by citing a United Nations report that he summarized as saying climate change \"is an existential crisis and it's getting worse.\"\n\n\"While people are being slaughtered? That's what Kerry is talking about?\" Christie asked as the other panelists tried to jump in. Panelist Donna Brazile interjected and said \"we can do two things at once.\"\n\nCHRIS CHRISTIE: BIDEN FALLING ASLEEP AT CLIMATE SUMMIT SENDS WRONG MESSAGE TO THE WORLD\n\n\"We can protect our planet, we can protect our earth, climate change is also real. That's why the only approach is not drill, drill, drill, our approach is to be strategic and make sure our European allies stick with us because it's going to get very painful,\" she continued, applauding Biden and his actions so far.\n\n\"It should have happened a long time ago,\" Christie said earlier in the segment of the potential oil ban. \"We should have been arming the Ukrainians for the last year, we weren't. We should have been doing much more on domestic production of oil, instead we're going backwards, and we gave Putin the card to hold us hostage.\"\n\nJonathan Karl, ABC's Chief Washington correspondent, said earlier on that it was \"extraordinary\" that Biden was sanctioning everything but Russian oil, \"the thing that drives their economy.\"\n\n\"The question of banning the import of oil and gas from Russia,\" Karl said. \"It is not insignificant. We actually take in more petroleum from Russia then we do from Saudi Arabia. It's extraordinary, George, for all the sanctions that have been imposed, and they have been unprecedented on Russia, to sanction everything but the thing that drives our economy.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",

Rachel May and Robert Jackson posing behind a sign that showed a plane with the words \"climate change\" heading toward the now-destroyed World Trade Center towers.\n\n\"It wasn’t a gaffe, it was a revealing display of how out of touch they are with everyday NYers,\" the post added.\n\nOn Twitter, May explained that she posed behind the sign without looking to see what it said.\n\n\"I attended the rally today to support a significant investment in climate change in the state budget,\" May tweeted Tuesday. \"I posed for numerous photos with activists, and did not see the content of the sign.\"\n\nDEMOCRATS PIVOT ON MASKS AS BIDEN POLLSTER SAYS THEY 'RISK PAYING DEARLY' FOR MANDATES AHEAD OF MIDTERMS\n\nMay added, \"The imagery on the banner is unacceptable and I would never endorse such a cynical use of our state’s history to score cheap points. I apologize sincerely to all New Yorkers and call upon the organizers to similarly condemn this message.\"\n\nJackson also apologized on Twitter saying that he too was unaware of what the sign said.\n\n\"I did not note the details of the artwork and would never support anything that denigrates the memory of all who were impacted by 9/11,\" Jackson said on Twitter. \"The artwork depicted is wrong and I fully reject it.\"\n\nThe post received criticism from many on social media including from New York State Republican Committee Chairman who called on May to resign.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFox News did not immediately receive a response to a request for comment from the office of Sen.

            "content": "Georgetown Law professor David Super claimed in an op-ed for The Hill on Monday that the way to fight inflation, is to focus on climate change.\n\n\"Largely ignored as an inflationary driver, however, has been climate change. Like the pandemic, climate change is a global problem manifesting itself in countless ways, many well-hidden. Unlike the pandemic, it will get worse, not better, for the foreseeable future.\" Super wrote. \"If we wish to control inflation, we must address climate change now.\"\n\nENERGY EXPERT CALLS ON BIDEN TO ‘FOCUS’ ON SOLUTIONS AND ‘UNLEASH’ AMERICAN ENERGY\n\nThe article, which was featured on The Hill, insisted that the effects of climate change are raising the prices of food, housing and all other goods in an inflationary manner.\n\n\"Extreme weather events and shifting weather patterns have caused global costs to soar across numerous commodities, from sugar and coffee to wheat and soy,\" Super wrote. \"And it is not just food, either. Housing becomes more expensive as wood and other building materials no longer grow well where they were traditionally harvested. Soaring weather-related claims push insurance companies to raise premiums sharply or just deny homeowners coverage.\"\n\nHe added, \"Both state governments and private utility companies inevitably pass on costs of increasing major weather disasters, fire mitigation, and grid resilience. Transportation costs rise — and are rolled into almost all goods’ prices — as storms damage bridges and wash out roads. The list goes on.\"\n\nOverall, he claimed that moving away from fossil fuels could actually help grow the economy and support \"cheaper\" alternatives.\n\n\"Despite near-record low unemployment, some writers worry that persistent inflation could adversely affect economic growth. Freeing ourselves from fossil fuel dependency is therefore crucial to containing inflation in the medium- and long-term as well as securing sustainable economic growth. And in the short-term, alternative energy now is actually cheaper than fossil fuels,\" Super wrote.\n\nIn addition, Super called for Congress to pass its latest economic package to enact clean energy provisions to combat climate change.\n\n\"The pending congressional economic package’s clean energy provisions would counter climate change’s increasing disruptions of our supply chains and prepare the way for sustainable, non-inflationary growth for decades to come. Congress should expeditiously finalize and pass this legislation,\" Super advocated.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn a Quinnpiac poll released in late April, inflation was found to be the most pressing issue for Americans among Republicans, Democrats and independents. By contrast, only 12% of Democrats were concerned about climate change along with only 7% of independents.",

According to Democrats, the earth's imminent destruction is now because of climate change. They really mean it this time. Now, naturally, the only way to save humanity is to give them more power.\n\nSo today, your president, Joe Biden boarded Air Force One and for a short, well, high carbon footprint flight to Massachusetts and then went for a ride in a giant fleet of SUV's, gas-guzzling SUVs, specifically shipped from Washington, D.C., and then traveled to a dust-covered lot filled with diesel-powered excavators where an Italian company plans to manufacture underwater cables for wind turbines at some point in the future.\n\nNow, as someone on Twitter put it, quote, Nothing screams reassurance like the President of the United States speaking live from an abandoned lot next door to a strip club near the airport. Biden was there to tout America's great transition to clean energy transition keyword and preview his big upcoming executive orders on climate change jobs start.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",

            "description": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told the press that \"climate change,\" \"mental health\" issues and \"addiction\" are to blame for the \"rise in threats\" to politicians.",
            "content": "During a recent press conference, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau pointed to issues like \"climate change\" and \"mental health,\" when asked why there has been a \"rise in threats\" against politicians.\n\nThe Canadian leader, who spent weeks demonizing truckers protesting his government’s COVID-19 mandates earlier this year, said \"climate change,\" the mentally ill, and economic changes – among other external factors – were to blame for people’s frustration with their governments. A handful of the prime minister's critics noticed that he conveniently left himself out of the blame game.\n\nPrompting Trudeau’s answer, one reporter asked, \"What do you think is behind the rise in threats that politicians are facing?\" After taking a quick beat to frame the answer, Trudeau sighed and responded, \"We’ve been through a lot, as a country, as a world, over these past years.\"\n\nHe then began his list of what’s inspiring the threats, stating, \"Obviously the pandemic, increasing anxiety because of climate change, transformations of our economy, um, rise in mental health and addiction problems – particularly with the opioid crisis that has been ravaging communities right across the country.\"\n\nHe continued, claiming, \"It’s a lot of pressure for a lot of people and unfortunately, um, there are no easy solutions for all these challenges we’re facing. \"\n\nThe prime minister laid out what would be needed to ease the tense situation. \"It’s gonna take hard work, it’s gonna take people listening to each other, it’s going to take orders of government and delivering for people. It’s a time for responsible leadership.\"\n\nTrudeau further declared, \"It’s time for people to look to assuage fears and angers, to respond with a positive vision of the future. But people are hurting. People are hurting because of all these things we’re going through.\"\n\n\"We need to make sure that the messages that we put forward as a country, and not just political leaders, but community leaders, institutions are focused on supporting each other,\" he added.\n\nThe one moment Trudeau hinted at politicians being a factor came towards the conclusion of his remarks. He stated, \"So each of us in positions of authority or power need to make sure that we are not inciting or encouraging anger or frustrations, but actually putting forward concrete, real solutions that are gonna bring people along and allow them to see themselves in the future that the world is creating.\"\n\nJUSTIN TRUDEAU’S NEW HAIRCUT DRAWS COMPARISON TO JIM CARREY’S 'DUMB AND DUMBER' LOOK\n\nTrudeau has been accused of adding to the anger and frustrations of Canadian people throughout the pandemic by other world leaders.\n\nIn March, Croatian Member of European Parliament (MEP) Mislave Kolakusic condemned Trudeau’s governance of his people, saying, \"Under your quasi-liberal boot in recent months, we watched how you trample women with horses, how you block the bank accounts of single parents so that they can't even pay their children's education and medicine, that they can't pay utilities, mortgages for their homes.\"\n\nAlternative for Germany MEP Christine Anderson also slammed Trudeau during his trip, calling him a \"disgrace for any democracy.\"\n\nConservatives on Twitter berated Trudeau for his recent statement.\n\n\"Here’s an easy solution: Vote the little punk out,\" tweeted conservative actor Mark Pellegrino.\n\nConservative YouTuber Viva Frei called Trudeau the \"Worst person in the history of Canada\" in his tweet.\n\nCanadian conservative outlet Rebel News, which shared the clip to Twitter, implied that Trudeau is to blame for the anger directed at him. The news account tweeted, \"Trudeau claims the rise in anger toward politicians stems from ‘increasing anxiety because of climate change,’ and states, 'it's a time for responsible leadership.' Do you believe him? See how he squashed a peaceful protest.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",

            "content": "New Jersey is the first state to introduce a mandatory climate change curriculum in schools.\n\nThe New Jersey State Board of Education on June 2020 adopted First Lady Tammy Murphy’s K-12 climate change education. The First Lady led the effort to integrate a climate change curriculum with the help of 130 educators.\n\nThe curriculum was scheduled to be enacted this school year, which requires all students to learn about climate change.\n\nNew Jersey set the precedent by being the first state in the nation to incorporate climate change education across its K-12 academic standards.\n\nNEW JERSEY SEX ED STANDARDS DISCUSSING ANAL SEX IN EIGHTH GRADE ‘AGE APPROPRIATE,' SAYS GOV. MURPHY\n\nGov. Phil Murphy, D., on September 6th that the curriculum is the \"first of its kind\" and \"will prepare and propel New Jersey students to the top of the ranks for the thousands of green economy jobs that will be made available in the future.\"\n\nThe New Jersey State Board of Education has 13 members who are appointed by the governor. These members serve without compensation for six-year terms.\n\n\"New Jersey has the number one public education system in the nation, and our teachers and school administrators are well-equipped to prepare our future climate change leaders to take on the climate crisis,\" Governor Murphy said. \"Our children are our future, and the lessons New Jersey students will learn with this new curriculum will bring us one step closer to building our green economy and reaching and sustaining 100 percent clean energy in New Jersey by 2050.\"\n\nHURRICANE IAN SLAMS FLORIDA AS SCHOOLS ACT AS SHELTERS: 'READY TO ACCEPT ANYONE WITH OPEN ARMS,' TEACHER SAYS\n\nK-12 climate change education will focus on how climate change has accelerated in recent decades and how it's impacted public health, human society, and contributed to natural disasters.\n\nClimate change education was also adopted by the state’s curriculum standard called New Jersey Student Learning Standards. The NJSLS laid out curriculum for New Jersey’s public schools and set \"the foundation for school districts to craft instruction and curricula.\"\n\nNJSLS’s K-12 climate change education was created to prepare students to understand how and why climate change happens and the impact it has on society as well as how people can respond to it. The standards will be incorporated across seven content areas such as \"21st Century Life and Careers, Comprehensive Health and Physical Education, Science, Social Studies, Technology, Visual and, Performing Arts, and World Languages.\"\n\nThe integration of climate change standards into the appendices of the mathematics and English language arts guidelines \"are up for review this year.\"\n\nHowever, some are opposed to the mandatory curriculum saying it could cause unnecessary panic among students and give parents more freedom to choose where they send their kids to school if they disagree with a school's curriculum.\n\nBethany Mandel, children's book author and homeschooling mother of five, told Fox News Digital that childhood mental health and anxiety levels are at all-time highs, and studies indicate that climate change alarmism is contributing to this stress.\n\n\"It’s our job as adults and parents to keep sacred childhood innocence, and refrain from burdening children with the problems of the world before they’re able to process what they’re being taught. New Jersey is making a choice: they would rather turn children into foot soldiers for the cause of climate change vs. keep their mental and emotional health safe,\" she said.\n\n\"New Jersey public schools spend over $24,000 per student per year. That funding should go directly to families, so they can find alternatives. Curriculum disagreements illustrate the need for school choice. Families disagree about how they want their children to be educated. The one-size-fits-all government school system will fail to meet the varied needs of families by definition. The only way out of this mess is to allow families to take their children's education dollars to the education providers that best meet their needs and align with their values,\" senior fellow at the American Federation for Children Corey DeAngelis told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"As with every politically motivated change in curricula, our public schools would do well to provide balanced lesson plans that enlightened young minds rather than cause panic and anxiety. Should educators pursue a comprehensive approach, students need to understand the complexity of science and climate modeling as it pertains to Earth's long history of significant changes in climate. They should also be aware of the secondary and tertiary economic consequences of various policy choices now and generations hence,\" Vice President of Education Policy at California Policy Center Lance Christensen said.\n\n\"Climate scientists are still studying how and why our climate is changing. It seems premature to mandate a subject in K-12 that remains unresolved in the scientific community,\" said Patrick Wolf, Distinguished Professor of Education Policy at the University of Arkansas.\n\nREPORT CARD ON BIG LABOR UNIONS SHOW SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF TEACHER UNION MEMBERSHIP SINCE 2018\n\nThe issue of education has become a top concern among voters heading into the midterm elections. Since the pandemic, school board meetings have become battlegrounds between parents and school board officials. Parents across the country have protested against COVID related restrictions in schools and controversial curriculum like critical race theory and gender theory. This has reignited the debate on how much control parents have over their children's education.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe fight for parental control of education spawned local groups like Fishers One based in Indiana and Minnesota Parents Alliance who launched an effort to train and support school board candidates and get parents involved in their schools and communities.\n\nThese parental rights groups hosted training for school board candidates across the state and plan to provide support for new school board members after elected to speak out against what they deem is indoctrination.",

It's happened since we've invented flying. And thankfully, it's actually gotten better because of the technology on the airplanes.\"\n\nJimmy Failla, host of \"Fox Across America,\" noted the curious lack of data to support the claim that climate change will make turbulence worse.\n\n\"The only data we have to support climate change is that people are getting rich selling it to us, and none of the people making that money are adhering to any of the guidelines they're forcing on us,\" Failla said.\n\n\"The reason people fall for this garbage is because they want to sound empathetic and considerate.\"\n\nTwitter users immediately responded to CBS News' claims, roasting the outlet for using a union official's statement as evidence.\n\nTammy Bruce, a Fox News contributor, sounded off on the flight attendant union for pushing blame onto climate change.\n\n\"This is a union entity reinforcing a government-Democrat narrative,\" Bruce said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBruce criticized organizations for turning things like airplane turbulence into a broader political issue, and she argued it will ultimately lead to more funding for the union.\n\n\"It's this vicious circle. It's typical. Shame on the flight attendants union,\" she said.",

            "description": "A year-end report fact-checked media companies like The Washington Post, The Associated Press, and The New York Times for tieing climate change to extreme weather.",
            "content": "The Associated Press took $8 million in donations to fund climate coverage in 2022, with the news cooperative and several other major media publications engaged in dubious claims about climate change, according to a new exclusive year-end report.\n\nThe \"Climate Fact Check 2022\" report, presented by the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), the Heartland Institute, Energy & Environmental Legal Institute, Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow (CFACT), and the International Climate Science Coalition (ICSC), stated that \"climate alarmists\" and members of the media engaged in claims about the relationship between manmade emissions and natural disasters which clashed with \"reality and science.\"\n\nIn February, The Associated Press admitted that they would assign over 24 journalists across the globe to cover \"climate issues,\" after receiving more than $8 million over three years from various organizations.\n\nBIDEN TURNS TO COUNTRY WITH DOCUMENTED CHILD LABOR ISSUES FOR GREEN ENERGY MINERAL SUPPLIES: 'IT'S EGREGIOUS'\n\nThe organizations contributing to the \"philanthropy-funded news\" via a \"climate grant\" are the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Quadrivium, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the Walton Family Foundation.\n\nAP News Vice President Brian Carovillano only accepts money \"without strings attached,\" and asserted funders have no influence on the stories conducted.\n\nSimilarly, in March 2021, high-ranking State Department officials discussed a proposal to sponsor foreign journalists to \"have experiences that educate them on reporting on climate change,\" according to the emails obtained by Protect the Public's Trust (PPT) and shared with Fox News Digital.\n\nSteve Milloy, a senior legal fellow at the Energy & Environment Legal institute told Fox News Digital that the Associate Press has essentially become a \"propaganda outfit\" for liberal organizations with climate agendas.\n\n\"It’s hard to claim it’s news when you’re being paid to report only one side of the climate discourse,\" he said.\n\nWH ADVISER JOHN PODESTA STAFFING UP WITH FAR-LEFT CLIMATE ACTIVISTS: 'NEED TO SET AMBITIOUS GOALS'\n\nThe report pointed to a recent article from The Associated Press, by reporter Seth Borenstein, called \"New abnormal: Climate disaster damage ‘down’ to $268 billion, as proof of bias.\n\nThe article attributed flooding in Pakistan, Hurricane Ian, droughts in Europe, China, and Africa, as well as deadly heat waves across the world to climate change.\n\n\"Weather disasters, many but not all of them turbocharged by human-caused climate change, are happening so frequently that this year’s onslaught, which 20 years ago would have smash records by far, now in some financial measures seems a bit of a break from recent years,\" Borenstein wrote.\n\nThe Climate Fact Check report questioned whether climate activists and \"media mouthpieces\" could legitimately attribute disaster damages to climate change, or if they were merely trying to \"surf human tragedy\" to advance a political agenda.\n\nThe report also highlighted several other climate claims from major media corporations, providing fact-checks for articles written by The Washington Post, The New York Times, and more.\n\nIn August, Times reporter Derrick Bryson Taylor claimed that Britain’s brief heatwaves this summer were worsened by climate change. A fact-check from the report noted that heat waves have dramatically declined in duration and frequency in the U.S. over the past 90 years, according to the National Climate Assessment.\n\nJOHN KERRY SAYS GREEN ENERGY TRANSITION ISN'T HAPPENING FAST ENOUGH: 'EVERYTHING HAS TO ACCELERATE'\n\nFurthermore, the report claimed it was \"unlikely\" that emissions are increasing heat waves in Britain, since hotter temperatures in the UK were offset by cooling elsewhere. Additionally, meteorologist Cliff Mass stated that while heat waves may bring temperatures 30 to 40 degrees above the norm, global warming is only in the noise level of 1 to 2 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nThe Washington Post in November published a piece by Barry Svrluga with the headline \"In this World Cup ski season, climate change is winning.\"\n\nThe piece claimed that climate change had led to shorter winters and made it so cold that only one of eight races were able to be held as of mid-November. A fact-check of the claim found that when the World Cup skiing started in the 1960s, the season began in January. However, now it begins in October.\n\n\"If the competition began in the winter everything would likely be okay because wintertime snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere has been increasing since the 1960s, the report claimed.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMilloy said that such claims have long been a part of the 30 years of \"climate hysteria\" cultivated by liberal media networks, and have little to show for their dire predictions.\n\n\"Instead of moving on to something else they’re doubling down on this, and they’re making themselves look worse at the same time,\" he added.",

            "content": "Canadian researchers analyzed coffee's \"contribution to climate change\" in a piece published in early January and suggested people moderate their consumption of the popular drink as a part of the solution.\n\nResearchers Luciano Rodrigues Viana, Charles Marty, Jean-François Boucher and Pierre-Luc Dessureault wrote in an analysis published in The Conversation that pollution from preparing coffee was \"just the tip of the iceberg.\"\n\n\"Limiting your contribution to climate change requires an adapted diet, and coffee is no exception. Choosing a mode of coffee preparation that emits less GHGs (greenhouse gases) and moderating your consumption are part of the solution,\" the researchers at the University of Quebec at Chicoutimi wrote.\n\nThe study also found that using coffee pods to brew coffee contributed less to the carbon footprint than brewing coffee with a traditional filter.\n\nBEN AFFLECK CAUSES SOCIAL MEDIA FRENZY SERVING DUNKIN' DONUTS TO CUSTOMERS, FIREFIGHERS: ‘LIVING THE DREAM’\n\n\"Our analysis clearly showed that traditional filter coffee has the highest carbon footprint, mainly because a greater quantity of coffee powder is used to produce the amount of coffee. This process also consumes more electricity to heat the water and keep it warm,\" the researchers wrote.\n\nThe researchers compared brewing with coffee pods, brewing coffee the traditional way in a coffee maker, brewing coffee with a French press and using instant coffee.\n\n\"Our analysis clearly showed that traditional filter coffee has the highest carbon footprint, mainly because a greater quantity of coffee powder is used to produce the amount of coffee. This process also consumes more electricity to heat the water and keep it warm,\" the researchers wrote.\n\nThey found that instant coffee was the most environmentally sound.\n\nFILTERED COFFEE IS MORE HEART HEALTHY THAN OTHER METHODS, STUDY CLAIMS\n\nCoffee production contributed more to contributed to total emission than coffee preparation, according to the analysis.\n\n\"This mechanization, irrigation and use of nitrous oxide-emitting fertilizers — the production of which requires large quantities of natural gas — greatly contribute to coffee’s carbon footprint,\" the researchers said.\n\nThe researchers also added that the convenience of coffee pods might lead people to double their coffee consumption and in turn make the environmental advantage \"redundant.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nStudies released last year found that drinking one to two cups of coffee a day may benefit heart health.\n\nThe American College of Cardiology found in a study released in March 2022 that coffee was associated with a reduced risk of heart disease and dangerous heart rhythms.",

This is petrifying… As we speak, Putin has been actively considering using a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine, so that's bad enough, but China and the Chinese Communist Party are tripling the size of their nuclear arsenal. They're developing hypersonic nuclear capable missiles that we can't defend against. And we have the commander in chief saying climate is more dangerous than nuclear weapons, and the thing that's so serious that Chinese listen to this, they hear it, and they know that this administration and Biden will make concession after concession to the Chinese in order to achieve their climate goals while China has the most rapid military buildup in modern American history. And the irony on top of it is that the Chinese are then dominating the global battery market, so they're making money off of it, in addition to us being distracted while they triple their nuclear arsenal. And my question for President Biden is, if Xi of China realizes his dream of becoming the dominant global superpower, do you think he's going to care about climate? Absolutely not.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",

            "content": "Researchers claim that moose are potentially a leading cause of climate change and that the species should be balanced, suggesting they are \"one of the biggest potential single sources of carbon emissions from wooded parts of Norway.\"\n\nThe Norwegian University of Science and Technology studied moose in Norwegian forests for several years and concluded that the species have a major effect on vegetation growth and are altering the carbon cycle by dining on tree buds. \"Moose are an ecosystem engineer in the forest ecosystem, and strongly impact everything from the species composition and nutrient availability in the forest. A grown animal can eat 50 kilograms of biomass each day during summer,\" Gunnar Austrheim, an ecologist at the NTNU University Museum, said in a press release.\n\nMoose tend to eat birch and young samplings in clearcut forests, an act researchers claim is where the ungulates \"gobble up\" possible carbon storage in trees.\n\nENERGY SECRETARY GRANHOLM CLAIMS US CAN ‘LEARN FROM WHAT CHINA IS DOING’ ON CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n\"It was really a surprise to see how much moose can influence vegetation growth, the carbon cycle and the climate system,\" said Xiangping Hu, a researcher at NTNU’s Industrial Ecology (IndEcol), said in the release.\n\nThe study also claimed that moose were not only bad for the climate but aided the forest industry.\n\nThe solution suggested to the latest climate change theory was to balance moose numbers and forest management in an effort to limit CO2 emissions. \"We don’t only regulate the amount of animals, we very carefully regulate the proportion of females, males and calves. So there’s a stronger management for moose than for most livestock in Norway,\" Francesco Cherubini, director of IndEcol Programme said. \"I think as we get more of an understanding of how all these different things are interrelated, land managers could come up with an optimal plan. That could be a much-needed win-win solution for climate, for biodiversity and for timber value.\"\n\nThe moose is not the first animal on climate activists labeled a potential threat to the climate after Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) linked \"farting cows\" to causing climate change.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn 2019, the congresswoman suggested \"we shouldn’t be eating a hamburger for breakfast, lunch, and dinner\" in her effort to reduce carbon emissions coming from cows.\n\n\"We set a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero, emissions in 10 years because we aren’t sure that we’ll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast,\" Ocasio-Cortez's FAQ page for the Green New Deal read.",

            "description": "Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro said this month that climate change is one of his top priorities despite escalating fears about China's growing naval presence.",
            "content": "Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro said he sees fighting climate change as a top priority for the Navy as the Biden administration proposes shrinking the fleet by two ships and worries grow about how the U.S. Navy stacks up to China’s.\n\n\"As the Secretary of the Navy, I can tell you that I have made climate one of my top priorities since the first day I came into office,\" Del Toro said March 1 in remarks at the University of the Bahamas.\n\nDel Toro said he met with Bahamas Prime Minister Philip Davis during his visit and spoke \"at length\" with him about the climate crisis and focused the bulk of his remarks on climate.\n\n\"The U.S. Navy and Marine Corps team has been working on climate and energy security for a long time,\" he said. \"And we are accelerating and broadening those efforts.\"\n\n\"We view the climate crisis much the same way as damage control efforts on a stricken ship. This is an all-hands-on-deck moment,\" he added.\n\nDel Toro spoke just days before the Biden administration released its proposed budget for 2024, which calls for shrinking the Navy fleet even though most military experts and senior Navy officers have called for more ships to deter China's larger fleet.\n\nFor several years now, the Navy has set a goal of having 355 manned ships. But, for the last three years, the Biden administration has proposed shrinking the fleet below the roughly 298 ships it has available now, instead of increasing it toward a 355-ship goal.\n\nThis year, the Biden budget called for the decommissioning of 11 ships and the construction of just nine ships, for a net loss of two vessels. That budget proposal was met with skepticism from members of Congress, which has acted in the last two years to spare the Navy from cuts to the fleet proposed by the Biden administration.\n\n\"No matter the favored phrase of the day — ‘divest to invest,’ ‘strategic pause,’ ‘capability over capacity,’ — the president’s defense budget is, in practice, sinking our future fleet,\" said Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee. \"A strong naval footing begins with readiness today and a plan to grow our battle force and command the seas tomorrow. President Biden is risking our maritime security by declining to work toward either of these goals.\"\n\nAs the Navy budget was being prepped for release, Del Toro was stressing the importance of using the Navy to fight climate change in the Bahamas and noting the many approaching climate-related events in which the Navy will participate.\n\nUS NAVY INTERCEPTS FISHING VESSEL TRYING TO SMUGGLE EXPLOSIVE MATERIAL FROM IRAN TO YEMEN\n\n\"There is not a trade-off between addressing climate security and our core mission of being the most capable and ready Navy-Marine Corps team,\" he said. \"The exact opposite is true. Embracing climate-focused technologies and adopting a climate-informed posture strengthens our capability to stand by our partners and allies.\"\n\nDel Toro said worrying about climate change would lead to new technologies that the Navy can use to create a \"virtuous cycle of energy efficiency, cost savings, maritime dominance and climate security.\"\n\nHe noted that Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry was just in the Bahamas and that he was going to meet with Kerry in Panama at the \"Our Oceans Conference.\" And he said the USNS Comfort, a 1,000-bed medical ship, is often in the Caribbean to help with \"climate-charged disasters.\"\n\nDel Toro said the chief of naval research would host a conference in Florida in April that will focus on how to \"address climate change and marine pollution, renew and hybrid energies applied to the naval field and integrating unmanned systems.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Climate change is one of the, if not the, most complex issues we have ever faced — as individuals, as nations and as a species,\" he said. \"And that is why my team and I are so fortunate to be here in Nassau exchanging ideas with all of you.\"",

Del Toro spoke with Bahamas Prime Minister Philip Davis during his visit and focused the bulk of his remarks on climate. The Navy has set a goal of having 355 manned ships for the last three years, but has proposed shrinking it below the roughly 298 ships it has available now. This year, the Biden budget called for the decommissioning of 11 ships and the construction of just nine ships, for a net loss of two vessels. Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., said a strong naval footing begins with readiness today and a plan to grow our battle force and command the seas tomorrow. He also noted that Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry was just in the Bahamas and that he was going to meet with Kerry in Panama at the \"Our Oceans Conference\" in April.",

            "description": "Department of Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm had a heated exchange Friday with Chief Deputy Whip Guy Reschenthaler on her previous comments praising China's energy policy.",
            "content": "President Biden's secretary of energy had an intense back-and-forth during a House Appropriations Subcommittee meeting on Friday.\n\nDepartment of Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm defended her previous comments praising China's environmental policy under interrogation by Chief Deputy Whip Guy Reschenthaler.\n\n\"Secretary, on March 10, 2023, you said, \"We can all learn from what China is doing\" — obviously about the environment,\" Reschenthaler said in the hearing. \"At the time you made that comment, were you aware that 30 percent of the world’s CO2 emissions came from China?\"\n\nENERGY SECRETARY GRANHOLM CLAIMS US CAN 'LEARN FROM WHAT CHINA IS DOING' ON CLIMATE CHANGE\n\nGranholm claimed earlier this month that Americans can \"learn from what China is doing\" in combating climate change.\n\nDuring an interview at the annual SXSW conference in Austin, Texas, Granholm sang the praises of China for its efforts to reduce climate change, claiming that the country is actually \"very sensitive\" about the issue, more so than the United States.\n\nReschenthaler continued pressing the energy secretary on the extent of China's emissions, the continued construction of coal power plants in the country, and its Paris Climate Accord-sanctioned ability to increase emissions until 2030.\n\nChina recently hit its coal-production record last year. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, \"55% of China’s energy\" now comes from coal, \"compared to 11% in the U.S.\"\n\nGranholm repeatedly clarified that she was aware of statistics on China's impact on the global environment.\n\nBIDEN ADMIN CRACKS DOWN ON WASHERS, FRIDGES IN LATEST CLIMATE ACTION: 'OVERREGULATION ON STEROIDS'\n\n\"Knowing that you knew all that when you made the comment, would you like to retract your praise for China?\" Reschenthaler asked.\n\n\"No, my praise for China was on what they are doing to invest in clean energy, even as they are the world’s largest emitter,\" Granholm told the Pennsylvania representative.\n\nShe added, \"They are also the largest investor in clean energy technologies — they invest four times more than the United States.\"\n\nReschenthaler went on to complain about comments Granholm had made in October 2019, in which she said the U.S. does not have the \"moral authority\" to criticize Chinese climate policies.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nGranholm clarified that she was not referring to China's human rights abuses, but only its energy policy.\n\n\"You were still talking about the moral authority of the U.S. v. China,\" Reschenthaler replied.\n\nGranholm accused Reschenthaler of taking her comments out of context.",

Reschnthaler continued to press Granholm on the extent of China's emissions, the continued construction of coal power plants in the country, and its Paris Climate Accord-sanctioned ability to increase emissions until 2030. Granholm also defended her comments that Americans can \"learn from what China is doing\" in combating climate change, claiming that the country is actually \"very sensitive\" about the issue. The hearing also highlighted China's coal-production record last year, and that it is now the world's largest emitter and invests four times more than the United States in clean energy technologies than the U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that 55% of China’s energy now comes from coal, \"compared to 11% in the U., and that 55%, of China is now from coal.",

            "content": "FIRST ON FOX: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) spent $4.3 million in funds from President Biden’s $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package on environmental justice and climate change programs promoting activities like tree planting, \"pruning workshops,\" and achieving \"greater acceptance of trees\" in cities.\n\nLast April, the EPA announced it was awarding $200,000 each to dozens of projects \"focusing on COVID-19 impacts, as well as climate and disaster resiliency\" in \"underserved communities\" through its Environmental Justice Collaborative Problem-Solving (EJCPS) Cooperative Agreement Program. The program awarded a total of 34 organizations using $4.3 million in funds from Biden’s American Rescue Plan (ARP) Act, as well as $2.5 million from the EPA’s annual appropriation for environmental justice.\n\nOne Indianapolis-based organization called Keep Indianapolis Beautiful was awarded $200,000 for an initiative called \"Greening Urban Neighborhoods\" which included educating residents about \"the benefits of trees\" and increasing \"acceptance of trees in the City.\"\n\nAnother organization, the New Mexico-based Tree New Mexico, received ARP funds to plant trees in the \"underserved area of the southeast quadrant of Albuquerque.\" That project included \"pruning workshops\" and providing \"tree care education\" with the goal of more residents becoming \"citizen tree stewards committed to caring for newly planted trees and older trees,\" and to decrease the \"heat island effect\" that occurs in urbanized areas.\n\nThe Houston-based Black United Fund of Texas received ARP funds through the EPA program for a project developing \"a shipping container farm, residential gardens, green technology, tree and native habitat planting, workforce development, and public education.\"\n\nAccording to the EPA website, the St. Paul, Minnesota-based Hourcar was also awarded EJCPS funds, funded by the ARP, to launch \"Evie carshare, a new all-electric carsharing program featuring 150 shared electric vehicles supported by 70 curbside charging stations, with a focus on service to low-income and BIPOC communities.\"\n\nThe USASpending.gov website, which documents government spending, says that the $200,000 in ARP funds for the grant was \"obligated.\"\n\nJust before Democrats passed the ARP in March 2021, without any Republican support, Biden described every allocation of funds in the legislation as essential.\n\n\"We need Congress to pass my American Rescue Plan that deals with the immediate crisis — the urgency,\" the president said at the time. \"Now, critics say my plan is too big, that it costs $1.9 trillion. So that’s too much. Well, let me ask them: What would they have me cut? What would they have me leave out?\"\n\nNow, the ARP is facing intensifying scrutiny for its role in the current inflation crisis, which hit a whopping 8.6% last month. Some economists, including former Obama administration economic advisers, have blamed the ARP for overheating the economy.\n\n\"While our nation is $30 trillion in the hole and hemorrhaging money on the federal level, news like this should outrage every taxpayer,\" Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., who sits on the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, told Fox News Digital in a statement. \"These examples are not appropriate functions of government, and are just the tip of the iceberg. The EPA – and I would argue every agency – must be held to account for how they’re utilizing public funds.\"\n\nFox News Digital previously reported that the EPA also used $5.25 million in ARP funds through its Environmental Justice Small Grants Program in 2021 to award grants for projects that had virtually little to do with addressing COVID-19 or the effects of the pandemic.\n\nOne of the nonprofits that received a grant through that program was the Massachusetts-based organization Speak for the Trees for a project utilizing \"storytelling\" and \"tree walks,\" among other techniques, aimed to \"increase awareness and dialogue surrounding inequitable tree canopy cover and its implications on the health of residents living in [environmental justice] communities.\"\n\nClean Air Carolina, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, received a grant for a project to install a public Level 2 EV charging station and to create an educational video as a way for \"community members to get involved to mitigate air pollution.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn a statement provided to Fox News Digital Wednesday evening, the EPA said all applications for the EJCPS program \"went through a rigorous scoring and approval process to ensure project activities and goals align with statutory authorities and the language and intent of ARP.\"\n\n\"All applications selected for funding were reviewed by EPA’s Office of General Counsel,\" the statement read. \"The EJ grants program funds community-driven projects. A basic tenet of environmental justice is that communities speak for themselves and are in the best position to know how to resolve challenges that they are facing. The EJ grants program, now with almost three decades of experience at awarding effective grants to communities across the country, has a record of investing taxpayer dollars in responsible ways and in places that meet communities’ needs and support longer term goals for community revitalization.\"",

            "content": "The war in Ukraine since Russia President Vladimir Putin's invasion has sparked some controversial analysis in the liberal media.\n\nUkrainians have taken up arms to defend their homeland as Russian troops continue to advance toward the capital, Kyiv. The invasion has claimed over 1,000 civilian casualties so far, according to the United Nations, while over 1 million refugees have fled to neighboring countries.\n\nWhile the war has united those of all political stripes in feeling compassion for the plight of the Ukrainian people, progressive pundits have uttered some partisan analysis of the fighting in recent days.\n\nMSNBC host Joy Reid claimed Monday that the war in Ukraine was getting so much attention due to demographics.\n\n\"The coverage of Ukraine has revealed a pretty radical disparity in how human Ukrainians look and feel to western media compared to their Browner and Blacker counterparts, with some reporters using very telling comparisons in their analyses of the war,\" Reid said on \"The ReidOut.\"\n\n\"We don’t need to ask ourselves if the international response would be the same if Russia unleashed their horror on a country that wasn't White and largely Christian, because Russia has already done it. In Syria,\" she added, referencing Russia's deployment of soldiers to against President Bashar al-Assad in the country's civil war.\n\nMSNBC'S JOY REID: WORLD PAYING ATTENTION TO UKRAINE BECAUSE IT'S A ‘WHITE…CHRISTIAN NATION’\n\nSeveral media pundits tried to tie the conflict in Ukraine to domestic matters. A few took swipes at President Biden, for instance, for failing to make a connection between the fight for freedom in Ukraine to voting rights efforts in the U.S. during his State of the Union address.\n\n\"Meet the Press\" host Chuck Todd and his guest, author and Princeton University professor Eddie S. Glaude Jr., agreed that Biden missed an opportunity to mention the anniversary of Bloody Sunday in his remarks on Ukraine. Bloody Sunday occurred on March 7, 1965, when unarmed civil rights protesters were met with violent resistance from local law enforcement during a march from Selma to Montgomery for voting rights. Todd said he was \"surprised\" by Biden's apparent whiff, while Glaude said he was \"stunned.\"\n\n\"If there's one thing that surprised me about the president's State of the Union, it was the lack of connecting the fight for democracy and freedom abroad with the fight for democracy and freedom at home. Today's Bloody Sunday,\" Todd said.\n\n\"I was stunned,\" Glaude said. \"I mean, it was an easy kind of rhetorical move: Let's defend democracy abroad and secure democracy at home.\"\n\nMSNBC, CNN, OTHERS STRAIN TO LIKEN UKRAINIAN PLIGHT TO DOMESTIC POLITICAL ISSUES\n\nMSNBC's Tiffany Cross made the same connection, saying on a recent episode of The Cross Connection that as she observes the chaos in Ukraine, she realizes, \"democracy can be a fragile thing, and it feels a bit fragile in America right now.\" She then accused the Republican Party of engaging in \"rampant voter suppression.\"\n\nIn a discussion about the possibility of the U.S. banning Russian oil ahead on Sunday's \"This Week,\" ABC's George Stephanopoulos called an \"existential crisis,\" defending comments made by former Secretary of State John Kerry that the war could have a \"profound negative impact on the climate.\" Biden announced a ban on U.S. exports of Russian oil Tuesday.\n\nLate night host Stephen Colbert irked viewers by appearing to downplay the impact rising gas prices have had on Americans.\n\n\"Today the average gas price in America hit an all-time record high over $4 per gallon. Okay, that stings, but a clean conscience is worth a buck or two. It's important. It's important. I'm willing to pay $4 dollars a gallon. Hell, I'll pay $15 a gallon because I drive a Tesla,\" Colbert said.\n\nCBS correspondents defended Biden's claim Tuesday that his policies had not affected the prices at the pump.\n\n\"He also made it clear, Weijia, that his policies, the Biden administration policies, are not hurting oil production in this country. He wanted to make that clear, too,\" \"CBS Mornings\" co-anchor Gayle King told CBS senior White House correspondent Weijia Jiang.\n\n\"Right, because that’s what Republicans have been saying very forcefully. Wondering why we can’t just ramp up oil production here. Well, the President just said that oil companies have the option to do that right now, but they aren’t taking it. And we did talk to a commodities expert, a strategist who said that’s exactly right,\" Jiang agreed.\n\nOther media figures like \"The View's\" Whoopi Goldberg and CNN's John Harwood chose to blame former President Trump for the current chaos or suggest the situation would have had been even more perilous if he was still commander in chief.\n\n\"If bonehead had been president, and I say what I said last time, there wouldn’t have been any issue because that guy would have handed Ukraine over to the Russians,\" Goldberg claimed Monday.\n\n\"When you hear Republican politicians snipe at Biden on the crisis, remember: the Republican president who left office last year used his term to strengthen Russia's hand and weaken Ukraine's, his party protected him as he did it, he still leads the party,\" Harwood tweeted of Trump.\n\nThe blame game amused Fox News contributor Joe Concha, who said on Fox News Tuesday that Trump was \"living rent-free\" in many liberal pundits' minds.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBiden announced a ban on all imports of oil and gas from Russia Tuesday, acknowledging it would hurt Americans at the gas pump, but would be a \"powerful blow\" to Putin.",

A few took swipes at President Biden, for instance, for failing to make a connection between the fight for freedom in Ukraine to voting rights efforts in the U.S. during his State of the Union address. \n\n\"When you hear Republican politicians snipe at Biden on the crisis, remember: the Republican president who left office last year used his term to strengthen Russia's hand and weaken Ukraine's, his party protected him as he did it, he still leads the party,\" Harwood tweeted of Trump.",

            "description": "Politico appears worried SCOTUS climate change ruling could weaken president's power to oversee American life",
            "content": "Politico was mocked for worrying that upcoming Supreme Court decisions could limit the executive branch in an article on Sunday.\n\nPolitico’s article \"How SCOTUS’ upcoming climate ruling could defang Washington\" was concerned about the case West Virginia vs. EPA which focuses on whether the Environmental Protection Agency can issue rules on the nation’s electrical grids without congressional authority. If the Supreme Court rules in favor of West Virginia, Politico notes, it could significantly impact the Biden administration’s efforts on climate change.\n\n\"The Supreme Court is expected to issue a ruling this month hobbling the Biden administration’s efforts to rein in climate change — but its impact could weaken the executive branch's power to oversee wide swaths of American life,\" Politico wrote on Twitter.\n\nIn the article, Politico specified that the EPA case could also \"unravel\" the regulatory state established by the New Deal.\n\n\"The Supreme Court and several Republican-appointed judges have invoked the same principle repeatedly during the past year to strike down a series of Biden administration responses to the coronavirus pandemic. Liberal legal scholars worry that the EPA case could yield an aggressive version of that thinking — unraveling much of the regulatory state as it has existed since the New Deal,\" the article stated.\n\nPolitico also quoted Georgetown University law professor Lawrence Gostin saying, \"A narrow reading of what the federal agencies can do is going to literally handcuff the federal government from taking action to protect Americans’ health safety and the environment.\"\n\nThe decision for case is expected to be announced this month\n\nRON DESANTIS CALLS OUT DEMOCRATS, MEDIA OVER THREATS TO SCOTUS: ‘TOTALLY ANTITHETICAL TO RULE OF LAW’\n\nConservatives ridiculed Politico’s concern that the executive branch could lose more power following the Supreme Court's ruling.\n\nThe Federalist senior editor David Harsanyi tweeted, \"It’s always incredibly how little political stories grapple with the constitutionality of these issues — which is the court’s job, though you’d barely know it. They just don’t care.\"\n\n\"And now we return to our regularly scheduled fear-mongering about Our Democracy,\" Townhall columnist Kurt Schlichter wrote.\n\nCommittee to Unleash Prosperity president Phil Kerpen joked \"Don't get our hopes up!\"\n\n\"Won't someone please think of the swaths?!,\" First Amendment lawyer Casey Mattox quipped.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Supreme Court has faced intense scrutiny by mainstream media outlets as of late for their upcoming rulings. The most notable ruling is Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which a draft opinion leak suggested could overturn Roe v. Wade.",

            "title": "'The View' knocks Herschel Walker over climate change response: 'Too many hits while playing football'",
            "description": "Georgia Senate candidate Herschel Walker was criticized by \"The View\" hosts for comments he made on the campaign trail against Democrats' Green New Deal.",
            "content": "\"The View\" host Sunny Hostin suggested Georgia’s Republican Senate candidate Herschel Walker had been hit too many times in the head while playing football, after giving his thoughts about the Green New Deal during a campaign stop on Saturday.\n\nWalker was criticizing the Democrat-backed plan to combat climate change, for putting an undue burden on America while rewarding the world's biggest polluters, such as China and India.\n\n\"The View\" played a partial clip of Walker arguing our clean air would be replaced with China's dirty air.\n\n\"Since we don't control the air, our good air decides to float over to China's bad air,\" Walker said in the clip. \"So, when China gets our good air, their bad air got to move. So, it moves over to our good air space. Then, now, we got to clean that back up.\" In the clip, Walker's supporters are heard laughing at his explanation.\n\nHERSCHEL WALKER SPOTLIGHTS IMAGE AS A ‘UNITER’ IN HIS FIRST GENERAL ELECTION AD IN GEORGIA SENATE RACE\n\nOnce the clip was done playing, the hosts reacted with shock and dismay. \"I don't know where his good brain cells moved to,\" Ana Navarro mocked.\n\nSunny Hostin suggested the Trump-backed GOP candidate was clueless to what he was talking about, and she was \"afraid\" that anyone would vote for him. She proposed that the former NFL running back and Heisman Trophy winner had been hit too many times in his previous career.\n\n\"[I]'m just very afraid that people even voted for him in the first place to become the Republican candidate and I mean I'm not a doctor or anything, but maybe too many hits while playing football or something like that, you know,\" she said.\n\nABC'S SUNNY HOSTIN CONDEMNED BY BLACK, LATINO REPUBLICANS FOR DISPARAGING REMARKS: ‘THAT’S RACISM RIGHT THERE'\n\n\"Makes me concerned that the Republicans would put him forward as a candidate to go against someone like Senator Raphael Warnock, who we know is just a terrific public servant and quite bright,\" Hostin gushed.\n\nHERSCHEL WALKER RIPPED BY WASHINGTON POST COLUMN CLAIMING AMERICA HAS ‘LOST ITS MIND’ IF HE WINS IN GEORGIA\n\n\n\nNavarro jumped in to quote Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson saying America will have \"lost its mind\" if Walker wins in Georgia.\n\nCalling his comments, \"crazy gibberish,\" she suggested they fit the GOP candidate's history of lying. \"There's a difference between ignorance and gaffes, right? There's a difference between ignorance and lies and hypocrisy,\" she slammed.\n\nThe ABC political talk show has shown a pattern of giving favorable coverage to Democrats while showing animus to Republican candidates.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAfter Warnock's Senate win at the start of 2021, the show's liberal hosts stopped former conservative host Meghan McCain from asking the Senator-elect tough questions.\n\nIn April, Ana Navarro praised \"the two [current] African American senators\" Sens. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., and Cory Booker, D-N.J., as trailblazers while ignoring Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., a Republican.\n\nA few weeks later, Sunny Hostin called Black Republicans an \"oxymoron,\" and said she didn't \"understand\" how Blacks and Latinos could call themselves Republican.",

            "content": "Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., made the claim Wednesday that climate change is the largest threat to national security facing the United States and the world.\n\nAt a news conference with the House Democratic Caucus leadership Wednesday, Crow, a former combat veteran serving on the House Armed Services Committee, discussed the National Defense Authorization Act.\n\nHe said when he first joined the U.S. Army, he remembers being on the receiving end of policies made in Washington, D.C. Crow then asserted that the Democratic Party is the party of national security – and that climate change is at the top of the list when it comes to serious threats.\n\n\"The bottom line is that the Democratic Party, the House Democratic Caucus, is the party of national security in the 21st century. We are the party that’s dedicated to rule of law, to affirming our connection to our allies, to addressing the largest national security threat facing our planet and our country – that is climate change, which is both a threat multiplier and a threat magnifier,\" Crow said. \"And dedicated to doing this in the right way.\n\nEX-CIA ENGINEER CONVICTED OF BIGGEST THEFT OF SECRET INFORMATION IN AGENCY'S HISTORY\n\n\"When we pass the National Defense Authorization Act this week, we have a couple of really important goals. One is we have to keep faith with our servicemen and women, those men and women who stand up and raise their right hand and take an oath that they’re willing to give their life to keep it,\" he said. \"We have to keep faith with their families. We have to address the threats – the very real and deep threats – from our adversaries. We have to send a message to our allies around the world that America is here, and we are here firm, we will stand with them in their greatest hour, or in their time of need, and we have to address climate change and the greatest threats that we face. That’s what this bill does.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"That’s what the House Democratic Caucus has done,\" he added. \"And I’m very proud to be a part of that effort and to join with my colleagues to say we will protect this nation, we will discharge our duties, and we will do so in the right and responsible manner.\"",

Critics of his regulations say they limit American energy production, damage the economy and weaken national security.\n\nThe board listed \"the costly consequences of misguided climate regulations, subsidies, and mandates.\"\n\nThe first is that countries like the United States \"can no longer take reliable electric power for granted.\" With a recent warning \"that two-thirds of the U.S. could experience blackouts this summer,\" the WSJ blames \"shrinking baseload power generation, which has been replaced by unreliable renewable energy\" - after all, \"Regulators can’t command the sun to shine or wind to blow.\"\n\nFurthermore, \"A third of the nation’s coal power and 10% of its nuclear capacity has shut down over the past decade owing to stricter environmental regulation and competition from cheap natural gas as well as heavily subsidized renewables. Natural gas generators have picked up some of the slack. But they are under stress from having to ramp up and down to balance intermittent renewables.\"\n\nUS WANTS TO END DEPENDENCE ON CHINA RARE EARTHS, YELLEN SAYS\n\nThe list continued, \"The rushed green transition is driving up energy prices across the board. Peak-time electricity wholesale prices this summer are projected to more than double in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest, according to the Energy Information Administration. Blame the left’s war on pipelines, which has constrained natural gas production even as demand grows.\"\n\nThe editorial board also listed energy \"Supply shortages\" as \"Failed climate policies are becoming an excuse for more government control of energy production.\"\n\n\"Europe’s climate obsession made itself vulnerable to the Kremlin, but Mr. Putin isn’t the only dictator smiling at the West’s energy woes,\" the editorial board wrote. \"President Biden had to beg the Saudis for more oil production, and his Administration may ease sanctions on Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro for more barrels of production. Iran may be liberated to export oil next.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Do Western leaders recognize or care that their climate monomania is endangering living standards in democracies and empowering authoritarians?\" the board asked.\n\n\"Historian Arnold Toynbee argued that civilizations die from suicide, not murder. The West’s climate self-destruction may prove him right,\" the Wall Street Journal editorial concluded.",

            "description": "Climate change is here and Congress must act now to create a cleaner, healthier world",
            "content": "Discussion of climate change may seem abstract or theoretical, but here in the Puget Sound region we are already feeling its effects. We see climate change in the increasing and intensifying wildfires, storms, heat waves, and other natural disasters that continue to become more deadly, displace more people, and expose more communities to harmful environmental and health hazards. Around the world, climate change is a major driver of displacement, famine, and conflict. If left unaddressed, these effects are only going to become more costly and deadly.\n\nClimate change represents the existential threat of our time and thinking about the sheer scope of the challenge can be terrifying. But the solution — transitioning off fossil fuels — presents an enormous opportunity for our country and our world. It’s not all doom and gloom.\n\nMoving to a clean energy economy can address some of the most-pressing issues facing individuals and families right now like health and wellbeing, energy costs, inflation, and economic opportunity.\n\nBIDEN SAYS HE WILL TAKE EXECUTIVE ACTION TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE SHOULD CONGRESS FAIL TO ACT\n\nFossil fuels have harmful effects on environmental health and wellbeing, which we have known about for years. Pollution from fossil fuels — whether from cars and trucks, gas furnaces and stoves, or manufacturing and industrial sites — negatively impacts public health, especially children and the most vulnerable members of our society. Transitioning to a clean-energy economy would drastically reduce harmful pollution and create cleaner, healthier communities.\n\nA system reliant on fossil fuels also has consequences for consumers and their pocketbooks. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the global rise in oil and gas prices illustrates the volatility of the fossil fuel market and the impact it has at the pump. The increase in fuel costs is one of the primary drivers of inflation. As consumers get squeezed with rising costs from inflation and higher fuel prices, oil companies have made record profits during this crisis. All the while, the oil industry and its allies have shamelessly called for an increase in domestic oil production, which is a false solution.\n\nOil and gas production in the U.S. has been at an all-time high in recent years and the Biden-Harris administration approved more drilling permits per month than President Donald Trump did in any of his first three years in office. No matter how much fossil fuel energy we produce domestically, U.S. consumers will always be subject to price hikes based on what’s happening in the global market.\n\nThe only way to be truly energy independent is to build an American economy no longer dependent on fossil fuels.\n\nA renewable and clean energy economy would help combat inflation and bring more affordable, stable energy to consumers, insulating folks from the volatility we see today in the price of gas, utilities, and everyday goods. Reducing our reliance on fossil fuels will remove a huge point of economic and political leverage that oil-rich autocratic leaders in Russia, Iran, and Saudi Arabia wield to their benefit. That means our transition to a clean-energy economy isn’t just smart domestic policy, it is also a matter of national security.\n\nSenator Joe Manchin, D-WV, reportedly wants to wait until September, when July’s inflation numbers are released, to decide how to proceed on climate provisions in a reconciliation legislative package. Like Manchin, folks around the country are worried about the price of gas and higher costs for everyday goods. I’m worried about rising prices too.\n\nBut that is exactly why we need to keep making the case that a clean energy economy can help address the challenges we face — including inflation.\n\nWe aren’t going to convince skeptics if we only talk about the existential threat of climate change. We must focus on the opportunity in front of us. An economy that runs on renewable and clean energy will improve people’s health and wellbeing; reduce energy costs for consumers; minimize drastic energy price swings; create good paying jobs; and promote national security and global stability.\n\nCongressional Democrats and the Biden-Harris administration have made clear our commitment to combating climate change. It’s been at the forefront of executive actions from day one of this administration, and it was a pillar of the Build Back Better Act that passed in the House last year.\n\nBut legislative days are quickly running out and we face hard choices. If an agreement on climate provisions can be reached with Manchin, the choice is clear.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nCongress must not squander our best opportunity to take significant climate action during Biden’s first term — it’s time to move a reconciliation bill that puts the country on a path toward net-zero emissions and to decarbonize every sector of the economy.\n\nIf we can successfully include other priorities — such as prescription drug pricing reform — then we should, but passage of a major climate bill is going to require members of Congress to make concessions on unresolved, non-climate related priorities and fight those battles separately. This is of course not the ideal outcome, but it is the prioritization necessary to push through a climate package that will truly catalyze our clean energy future.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIf an agreement can ultimately be reached with Manchin on investments in climate and clean energy, we cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Our collective success will require all of us who take climate change seriously to convince the American people, especially skeptics, that passing an aggressive clean energy package is an opportunity to not only tackle climate change, but also address some of the pain points that Americans across the country are feeling right now. It’s on us, and the time is now.",

            "description": "At least a few blue state Democrats are on the fence about President Biden’s tax hike and climate change legislation because it does not restore the lucrative SALT deduction.",
            "content": "A handful of House and Senate Democrats is on the fence about President Biden’s tax hike and climate change legislation because it does not restore a federal income tax break that primarily benefits blue states.\n\nThe lawmakers, mainly from the Northeast states, say they are disappointed that the bill does not heed their calls to restore the State and Local Tax — SALT — deduction. In the 50-50 split Senate, in particular, Democrats say the exclusion can be costly since the legislation is slated to pass via a party-line process known as budget reconciliation.\n\n\"Anybody can be Joe Manchin,\" said New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez, referencing his West Virginia colleague who delayed the reconciliation process for months until his demands were met. \"I can be Joe Manchin right now.\"\n\nMenendez was quick to note, however, that he would look at the \"totality of the bill\" before making a final decision. The sentiment was echoed by several House Democrats as well.\n\nGREEN NEW DEAL DEMOCRATS CHANGE TUNE ON JOE MANCHIN AFTER $433 BILLION CLIMATE, INFLATION BILL\n\n\"I’ve got to understand the impact it has on families in my district,\" Rep. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., told reporters. Until I see specifics, it’s hard to know.\"\n\nSALT could prove to be a major dividing point given that Democrats hold narrow control of Congress. With the Senate split evenly between both parties, Democrats cannot afford any defections there on the spending bill.\n\nLikewise in the House, Democrats only have a four-seat cushion to pass legislation. One House Democrat, Rep. Jared Golden of Maine, is already seen as a likely no vote given his opposition to SALT in the past.\n\nThe lucrative deduction allows individuals to write off a certain portion of the taxes they pay to state and local governments on their federal returns. It once provided significant tax relief in states like New York and California, where the local tax burden is heavy.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax bill capped the deduction to $10,000 per year. It also changed the eligibility criteria, allowing filers to deduct property taxes and state income or sales taxes but not both.\n\nCritics argue that it delivers a benefit to only one section of the country.\n\n\"Our tax code should not favor red-state or blue-state elites with loopholes like SALT,\" said Manchin.\n\nProponents disagree, however. They say states like New York and New Jersey pay significantly more in taxes to the federal government than they get back via grants and programs.\n\n\"More than 50% of families in [my district] took the SALT deduction before it was capped in 2017,\" said Rep. Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J., recently. \"Let’s keep our promises to them and families across the country who have been unfairly doubled taxed since then.\"\n\nSENATE CAMPAIGN CHAIRS SPAR OVER IMPACT OF MANCHIN INFLATION BILL: 'IT'S ALL LIES'\n\nDespite the rhetoric, both the nonpartisan Tax Foundation and the liberal-leaning Brookings Institution say the SALT deduction largely benefits the wealthy.\n\n\"Households making $1 million or more a year would receive half the benefit of repealing the $10,000 federal cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction,\" a study by the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center found. \"Seventy percent of the benefit would go to those making $500,000 or more.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe study further found that 96% of middle-income households would get no tax reduction at all by restoring SALT.\n\nOn the other hand, nearly 93% of households making more than a million dollars annually would receive a tax cut averaging $48,000.",

It once provided significant tax relief in states like New York and California, where the local tax burden is heavy. It also changed the eligibility criteria, allowing filers to deduct property taxes and state income or sales taxes but not both. They say states like New York and New Jersey pay significantly more in taxes to the federal government than they get back via grants and programs.",

Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., issued a dire warning to the U.S., telling officials Tuesday to learn from their mistakes in Ukraine and Afghanistan to avoid losing World War III against China in the future. On \"The Faulkner Focus\" Tuesday, Gallagher ripped the Biden administration for retaining a fear of provoking U.S. adversaries, including China.\n\nREP. MIKE GALLAGHER: Quite simply, this administration seems to be afraid at every step of the way of provoking our adversaries. If you've seen what's happened in Ukraine, they've consistently signaled that what we're not going to do out of fear of provoking Putin. The same thing I think is true here. We're so risk averse, we're afraid of provoking the Chinese Communist Party. We put ourselves in a straitjacket, and it's constricted our ability to think creatively, to move aggressively. There's one other thing going on: there's a divide in the administration. There are those with a more realistic view of China that want to work with Republicans on the Hill to enhance our deterrent posture, and then there's a wing of the administration that believes climate change is our biggest, overarching threat and, therefore, we need to have a more cooperative relationship with the Chinese Communist Party to combat climate change. I believe that second camp is naive, and I believe they are responsible for a lot of the incoherence that we've seen on our overall grand strategy vis a vis China.",

            "content": "Wisconsin Democrats believe climate change is a greater concern than inflation and economy, according to a new poll from the key midterm state.\n\nA new Marquette University poll Wednesday found that the majority of Democratic voters in Wisconsin believe climate is the most concerning issue, receiving 79% of the vote. Inflation ranked as the sixth most concerning issue to Democrats, ranking lower than public schools, gun violence and abortion rights.\n\nThe registered voters expressed they are more concerned for the climate than inflation, despite it hitting a 40-year high of 9.1% in June. Following the soaring prices of consumer goods and gas, the gross domestic product (GDP) dropped for a second consecutive quarter in July and the economy entered into a technical recession.\n\nFor 91% of Republicans and 67% of independents in Wisconsin, inflation was the issue of the highest concern. Climate change ranked the least concerning issue for Republicans.\n\nCLIMATE ACTIVISTS EMBRACE EXTREME TACTICS, VIOLENCE AS DEADLINE TO ‘SAVE THE PLANET’ DRAWS NEAR\n\nDemocrats have prioritized their climate agenda going into the 2022 midterm elections, swiftly passing through the new climate and tax bill titled the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.\n\nPresident Joe Biden received a job approval rating of 40% among the registered voters, with 55% disapproval in the Badger State. The president's approval rating is unchanged from a June poll.\n\nThe survey found that Democrat Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes is leading in the Wisconsin Senate race by 7 percentage points with 51% support, while 44% support current Senator Republican Ron Johnson. The results show a radical change among registered voters in the state when compared to a June poll that found Barnes with 46% support and Johnson 44%.\n\nA spokesperson for the Ron Johnson for Senate campaign reacted to the poll in an exclusive statement to Fox News Digital, saying, \"There were 56 public polls in the 2016 election cycle and 52 predicted a Russ Feingold win. In 2022, voters will learn about Lt. Gov. Barnes' desire to fundamentally transform America and the state: more spending, higher inflation, letting criminals walk free from prison and raising people's taxes. And Ron Johnson will win again.\"\n\nThe survey is the second this week to indicate that a Democratic Senate candidate is leading in their Senate race against an incumbent Republican, after a University of North Florida poll Tuesday found Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla., was ahead in the Senate race against Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.\n\nIn the Wisconsin gubernatorial race, the poll showed that 45% of registers voters support Democratic Gov. Tony Evers and 43% his GOP opponent Tim Michels. Independent candidate Joan Beglinger received 7% support.\n\nWisconsin's primary election took place in early August, in which the candidates who received the most votes advanced to the midterm elections that are set to take place this fall.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Marquette University survey was conducted from Aug. 10-15, 2022 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.2 percentage points.",

            "content": "newsletter published an article by staff editor Spencer Bokat-Lindell arguing that declining fertility rates and a shrinking population could be a good thing to help the world combat climate change.\n\nThe article, titled \"U.S. Population Growth Has Nearly Flatlined. Is That So Bad?\", speculated that population decline may \"actually bring welcome changes.\"\n\n\"For a population to replenish itself in the absence of immigration, demographers estimate that there must be, on average, about 2.1 births per woman,\" Bokat-Lindell noted while pointing out that in the United States, the fertility rate has been below that since 2007.\n\n\"[T]he global average fertility rate has been falling for decades, and , the world’s largest, may very soon reach its peak,\" he wrote.\n\nFOX NEWS PRESSES WHITE HOUSE ON KAMALA HARRIS'S CLAIM THE BORDER IS SECURE\n\nHe cited a projection that \"the human population will start declining by the end of the century.\"\n\nBokat-Lindell wrote that the main concern people have with falling fertility rates is that, eventually, there will not be enough working age people to support the older retirees. However, he argued that automating away jobs will help address this problem, and the economic hardship caused by a declining population will make people less inclined to consume energy, which he says is good for the planet.\n\n\"The challenges of an aging population could push countries to pursue policies that improve quality of life,\" he argued.\n\nOne way he said governments should address \"labor shortages caused by population aging is by investing more in the automation of work.\"\n\n\"Fertility rate declines may also be making climate change easier to combat, albeit not in the way many think,\" he wrote.\n\n\"As Sarah Kaplan of The Washington Post has explained, fossil fuel consumption is driven primarily by increases in affluence, not the number of people on the planet per se,\" he continued.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHe went on to argue that population growth in rich countries like the U.S. would \"almost certainly\" lead to \"large increases in planet-warming emissions,\" which he says is bad for the planet.",

            "description": "Left-leaning media outlets continued their criticism Governor Ron DeSantis and warned of the impact of climate change in Florida as Hurricane Ian made landfall.",
            "content": "With Hurricane Ian dominating news coverage as it descends on Florida, some figures on MSNBC, CNN and ABC took time to rip into Gov. Ron DeSantis, R., and warn of the effects of climate change on The Sunshine State.\n\nOn Tuesday, MSNBC’s far-left host Joy Reid suggested that those temporarily leaving the state under hurricane evacuation orders were no different from migrants crossing the border in search of work in the U.S., connecting it to DeSantis' stunt sending migrants to Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts.\n\n\"It’s a bit ironic now that you might have Floridians having to pour over the borders and go north and get out of the state of Florida in the exact same crisis we have been talking about on a trolling level in that state for a long time,\" she said.\n\nShe added that DeSantis should be careful about \"attacking people who have to move to save their own lives and safety,\" because you never know when it will be your own people who may need to do the same. Reid also joked that the emergency situation in Florida will force DeSantis to do something other than \"owning the libs.\"\n\nCommentary about the storm continued on \"The 11th Hour\" with host Stephanie Ruhle, who opened a segment with a scathing critique of DeSantis hitting on climate change, as well as the state of the property and insurance market in Florida.\n\n\"Florida Governor DeSantis has made more headlines for cruelty than governing lately in a state where the property and insurance market has almost collapsed, as insurance companies have folded or leave the state completely,\" Ruhle said. \"Climate change making the storms bigger and more costly—while Florida’s Republican legislatures mostly ignore the threat completely.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, DeSantis also drew the attention of ABC’s \"The View,\" with the panel mocking and slamming him as he called on the federal government and other states for help.\n\nWhoopi Goldberg reacted to an interview of DeSantis by agreeing that he and the president should put their differences aside and attempt to help the people of Florida. But, as Goldberg attempted to push a message of political civility, co-host Joy Behar interjected.\n\nHURRICANE IAN: DESANTIS WARNS OF 'NASTY' DAYS AHEAD, TELLS FLORIDIANS IT'S TOO LATE TO EVACUATE\n\n\"Isn’t it socialism when the government helps you?\" Behar smirked.\n\nSunny Hostin then jumped in, and added that Republicans seem to believe that as it pertains to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.\n\n\"Yeah, and the fire department’s got to come, and the police, I mean socialism,\" Behar said as she did her best to appear scared.\n\nMoments later, Behar read off a notecard of a quote from DeSantis in which he declared that he was not among the ranks of people he considered to be \"global warming leftists.\"\n\n\"This is what he thinks about climate change and now his state is getting hit with one of the worst hurricanes that they will ever see,\" Behar fumed.\n\nDiscussions about climate change also were propagated in the last two days on CNN.\n\nDuring one back-and-forth on climate change, CNN’s Don Lemon was shut down by Jamie Rhome, who serves as the acting director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) National Hurricane Center.\n\nWhile speaking on meteorologists' concerns that Hurricane Ian could enter \"another period of rapid intensification,\" Lemon asked Rhome what effect climate change has had.\n\n\"We can come back and talk about climate change at a later time. I want to focus on the here and now. We think the rapid intensification is probably almost done. There could be a little bit more intensification as it's still over the warm waters of the eastern Gulf of Mexico, but I don't think we’re going to get any more rapid intensification,\" Rhome said.\n\n\"Listen, I’m just trying to get, you said you want to talk about climate change. But what effect does climate change have on this phenomenon that is happening now? Because it seems these storms are intensifying. That’s the question,\" Lemon asked.\n\nRhome replied he did not believe that climate change could be linked to any one event, and said that while climate change on the whole may make storms worse, he cautioned against pointing to singular events as directly related to a change in the Earth’s climate.\n\n\"Listen, I grew up there and these storms are intensifying—something is causing them to intensify,\" Lemon said.\n\nCNN chief climate correspondent Bill Weir also spoke about climate change while reporting in his rain jacket, as heavy winds and rain pummeled him and the surrounding area of Punta Gorda, Florida.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWeir began with a bit of history, noting that the coastal town was one of the first in Florida to put in a \"climate adaptation plan\" after the impact of Hurricane Charlie in 2004.\n\n\"This will be the test,\" Weir added. \"It’s hard to build power lines or building codes for a 17-foot storm surge, though. That’s the crazy variable here right now. Nobody has ever seen that. So we don’t know what that looks like. But this is exactly what climate scientists have been warning about for a long time, and now we get to see it up close.\"",

            "content": "The New York Times blasted Florida Republicans for opposing climate change legislation while seeking Hurricane Ian relief.\n\nThe paper declared, \"Florida Leaders Rejected Major Climate Laws. Now They’re Seeking Storm Aid,\" in a piece filed under their Midterms 2022 election coverage. The piece suggested Republicans voting record could've helped prevent the \"cause\" of hurricanes.\n\n\"Hurricane Ian’s wrath made clear that Florida faces some of the most severe consequences of climate change anywhere in the country. But the state’s top elected leaders opposed the most significant climate legislation to pass Congress, laws to help fortify states against, and recover from, climate disasters, and confront their underlying cause: the burning of fossil fuels,\" the paper lectured.\n\nThe paper called out Florida senators Marco Rubio and Rick Scott for voting against the Inflation Reduction Act, as well as last year's$1.2 Trillion dollar infrastructure bill. Gov. Ron DeSantis didn't escape the paper's condemnation either for blocking the state's pension funds being used to combat climate change.\n\n\"In the aftermath of Ian, those leaders want federal help to rebuild their state — but don’t want to discuss the underlying problem that is making hurricanes more powerful and destructive,\" the outlet warned.\n\nThe Times is just one of many media outlets, including MSNBC, CNN and ABC, who blamed climate change for the destructive storm.\n\nTUCKER CARLSON: DEMOCRATS USE DISASTERS TO PUNISH THOSE WHO DIDN'T VOTE FOR THEM\n\nHowever, some climate experts disagree, pointing to a NOAA study which found its models didn't support the claim that \"greenhouse gas-induced warming leads to large increases in either tropical storm or overall hurricane numbers in the Atlantic,\" Fox News Digital reported.\n\nRegardless, the Times argued Florida had long felt \"the impacts of climate change,\" and blamed Republican leaders for \"resisting\" a far-left climate agenda to avoid catastrophe.\n\n\"Yet the state’s leaders have long resisted what scientists say is needed to stave off a catastrophic future: an aggressive pivot away from gas, oil and coal, and toward solar, wind and other renewable energy sources,\" the liberal paper protested.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Times also called out the Republican governor for asking the Biden administration for help in the aftermath of Ian, after previously voting against a federal aid package for Hurricane Sandy victims when in Congress. The paper suggested this prior decision would \"come back to haunt him.\"\n\nIn 2013, then-U.S. Representative DeSantis voted against a federal aid package in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, saying it wasn't \"fiscally responsible.\"\n\nA New York Times article last week joined several other media outlets in mocking the Florida Governor for his past position, saying he was \"banking\" on Americans' \"short memory\" in asking for aid.",

            "content": "Wisconsin voters sounded off on what they consider the most important issues heading into the midterm elections, with most telling Fox News that the economy and climate change were top priorities.\n\n\"Inflation is out of control,\" Matt, from Wisconsin, said. \"We gotta get gas prices down because I don’t want to be paying that much at the pump.\"\n\nInflation, which nationally hit a 40-year-high of 9.1% in June, was the top issue for registered Wisconsin voters, with two-thirds saying they were \"very concerned\" about soaring prices, according to an August Marquette University survey. Gun violence and crime followed closely behind, while 41% said they were very concerned about climate change.\n\n\"It’s getting kind of scary,\" London, a Democrat from Milwaukee, told Fox News, citing climate change as her top priority. She said her concerns are apparent considering the flooding following Hurricane Ian and that several regions facing severe droughts.\n\n2022 MIDTERM ELECTION NEWS AS DEMOCRATS, GOP FIGHT TO CONTROL SENATE, HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\n\n\"It’s only going to get worse if we don’t act on it now,\" London said.\n\nNearly 80% of Democratic Wisconsin voters said climate change was their top priority, according to the Marquette poll, while Republicans ranked it their lowest concern. Meanwhile, 91% of Republican voters cited inflation as their main issue, which Democrats ranked sixth.\n\nBut while climate change is a major concern for Chase, a Democrat, it wasn't his top issue. Instead, his priority is on reining in government spending to ease inflation.\n\n\"Even as a Democrat, as a moderate Democrat, I’m still concerned about that,\" Chase said. \"The deficit is out of control.\"\n\nBIDEN SIGNS $739 BILLION INFLATION REDUCTION ACT, SLAMS GOP FOR VOTING AGAINST THE TAX, CLIMATE DEAL\n\n\"I moved here for my first middle class job and still the cost of living as a single person is ridiculous,\" Chase continued. \"Milwaukee’s not even an expensive city.\"\n\nShelter costs in U.S. cities, including rent prices, rose .07% from July to August, the steepest increase since 1991, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In expensive urban areas like New York City, rents decreased by .9% over the last month but increased 12.1% compared to October 2021, according to the Apartment List.\n\nSeveral voters mentioned crime as their top priority.\n\n\"In a city like this, it's almost like you have rules when you walk down the street,\" one Milwaukee resident said. \"Be careful how you look at certain people because now you can’t talk to everybody.\"\n\nWisconsin saw 321 homicides in 2021 — nearly double the number in 2019, according to data. Some violent crimes decreased, such as a 10% drop in robberies, but aggravated assaults rose 12% over the same period.\n\n\"It’s kind of hard to feel safe anywhere,\" another voter said. \"There’s no such thing as freedom here.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAnother Wisconsin voter, Miles, said there are many issues to be addressed, but he isn't confident any candidate to fix them.\n\n\"Not sure I trust either party to solve them,\" Miles told Fox News, saying candidates are \"just talking heads.\"\n\n\"They try to do their best but they really are just out for themselves,\" Miles said.",

Our gas prices have been skyrocketing ever since he canceled the pipeline.\"\n\nWATCH BELOW TO SEE MORE OF AMERICANS GRADING BIDEN\n\nBut a Texan with a thick mustache disagreed and gave Biden a B on the economy.\n\n\"He's doing a good job keeping it together and trying to help people that need it,\" he told Fox News.\n\nImmediately after taking office, Biden canceled a federal permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, which would have allowed for the transport of 830,000 barrels of oil per day. Critics have said the move led to increased gas prices.\n\n\"We're in Texas right now. They literally had a thousand people come in in one day,\" she told Fox News.\n\nThe mustachioed Texan, however, gave Biden a C or D on immigration.\n\n\"It really isn't his fault. That's a generational problem that's gonna to take a long time to correct,\" he told Fox News.\n\nMIGRANT IN POTENTIALLY THE LARGEST CARAVAN EVER DEMANDS BIDEN KEEP ASYLUM PROMISE\n\nA migrant caravan of more than 1,000 people illegally crossed into El Paso, Texas, from Mexico within a four-hour period on Dec. 11, according to the Texas Tribune. And the Border Patrol's El Paso sector recorded over 2,150 illegal immigrant encounters each day for the first two weeks of December.\n\nThe Nebraskan, meanwhile, also gave Biden an F on foreign relations.\n\n\"We've kind of given a blank check to the war in Ukraine,\" he told Fox News. \"We shouldn't just be giving people money to engage in wars that we may not have really an interest in.\"\n\nThe Biden administration has sent nearly $20 billion in military aid to Ukraine since its war with Russia began. Biden has said Ukraine should be able to defend its sovereignty from Russia's unprovoked aggression.\n\nAn Austin resident agreed, giving the president a D on foreign relations.\n\n\"He's not presenting the United States in a positive light,\" she told Fox News.\n\nOne woman gave Biden a C on climate change.\n\n\"I haven't heard actual action steps or plans that they're implementing,\" she said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"We've gone through giant strides of technology to get the United States clean, where he supports China. And China is one of the dirtiest countries as far as climate goes,\" the Austin resident told Fox News.\n\nTo watch more of Americans grading Biden's 2022 performance, .",

I've had my family at a movie theater, when the movie stopped, my children immediately felt there must be a shooter in the theater with us.\"\n\n\"These are the type of experiences that we are going to bring as we continue to push to meet this moment of challenge for the American people with progress,\" she added.\n\nINCOMING DEM WHIP CLARK RECALLS CHILD ‘WAKING UP WITH NIGHTMARES’ OVER CLIMATE CHANGE\n\nDowell, 23, was arrested and charged with assault with a dangerous weapon, destruction or injury of personal property, and damage of property by graffiti.\n\nThe Boston Police Department referred to the suspect as \"Jared Dowell.\" Clark has spoken in the past about how one of her children is non-binary.\n\nOfficers were called to the Parkman Bandstand Monument in the Boston Common around 9:30 p.m. on Saturday evening about a protest.\n\nWhen they arrived, they saw Dowell allegedly spray-painting \"ACAB,\" which stands for \"All Cops Are Bastards,\" and \"NO COP CITY,\" an apparent reference to a police training facility in the suburbs of Atlanta that has sparked protests after officers shot and killed a protester who allegedly opened fire on them, injuring one, earlier this week.\n\nWhile police arrested Dowell, a group of 20 protesters \"began to surround officers while screaming profanities though megaphones on the public street causing traffic to come to a standstill,\" according to police.\n\nThe protesters were \"interfering with the arrest\" and \"an officer was hit in the face and could be seen bleeding from the nose and mouth.\"\n\n\"I love Riley, and this is a very difficult time in the cycle of joy and pain in parenting,\" Clark tweeted. \"This will be evaluated by the legal system, and I am confident in that process.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDowell will be arraigned in Boston Municipal Court.\n\nClark, 59, is the second highest-ranking Democrat in the House of Representatives after being elected whip last month.",

            "content": "U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm claimed Friday that Americans can \"learn from what China is doing\" in combating climate change.\n\nDuring an interview at the annual SXSW conference in Austin, Texas, Granholm sang the praises of China for its efforts to reduce climate change, claiming the country is actually \"very sensitive\" about the issue, more so than the United States.\n\nGranholm made these claims despite the fact that China recently hit its coal-production record last year. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, \"55% of China’s energy\" now comes from fossil fuel \"compared to 11% in the U.S.\"\n\nSXSW Studio host Wajahat Ali conducted the interview with Granholm and mentioned China’s negligence on climate during their discussion.\n\nHe prompted Granholm, saying that China and the U.S. are doing \"so much damage to the world\" by neglecting the climate.\n\nAli said, \"I want to talk about accountability. We don’t know what’s going to happen, but — with China specifically, right? When we’re talking about, if it’s Wuhan, or if it’s not, but accountability when it comes to those countries that are doing so much damage to the world, when it comes to climate change. I hate to say it’s China and it’s also the United States of America.\"\n\nHe asked, \"How do we hold China and ourselves accountable for what we are doing around the world?\"\n\nGranholm said that the U.S., led by official Climate Envoy John Kerry, has been trying to \"get all of these countries to agree to very aggressive targets to be able to make sure that we don’t get climate — global warming happening over, you know, 1.5 degrees.\"\n\nBIDEN ADMIN CRACKS DOWN ON WASHERS, FRIDGES IN LATEST CLIMATE ACTION: 'OVERREGULATION ON STEROIDS'\n\nShe explained how the U.S. wants \"to get to net zero by 2050\" and is \"really pushing other countries to do the same.\"\n\nGranholm said, \"I mean, there’s a couple of countries that we know are outliers and don’t care,\" but clarified that China isn’t actually one of them.\n\nShe then praised China’s climate change efforts, saying, \"But, I think China has done — has been very sensitive, and has actually invested a lot in their solutions, to achieve their goals.\"\n\nGranholm added, \"So we’re — we’re hopeful that, you know, we can all learn from what China is doing.\"\n\nThe secretary also noted, \"the amount of money that they’re investing in clean energy is actually, you know, encouraging.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe U.S. and China have on the climate crisis in the last couple of years, though some experts don’t believe that China is as serious about protecting the climate as the country claims.\n\nTexas Public Policy Foundation chief national initiatives officer Chuck DeVore told Fox News Digital in January that China’s climate change initiatives are \" to engage gullible Westerners into thinking that somehow we can get meaningful cooperation.\"",

            "content": "U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm loudly implored Americans to take climate change seriously during an interview, Friday.\n\nWhile urging viewers to tune into her upcoming speech at the SXSW festival in Austin, Texas, Granholm looked into the camera and screamed, \"Climate change is an existential threat!\" She then demanded to know if Americans even care about the future or their children.\n\nThe over-the-top clip came from an interview Granholm did with journalist and SXSW Studio host Wajahat Ali during the famous multi-day tech and culture festival in Texas. Ali and Granholm discussed issues pertaining to climate change and the U.S.’s foray into clean energy production.\n\nAt one point during the interview, Granholm sang the praises of China's climate change initiatives and noted that the U.S. could \"learn\" from them, even though the massive Asian country is ranked among the biggest contributors to climate change on the planet.\n\nThings escalated, however, when Granholm made a pitch to festival goers to attend her speech on American clean energy later at the event.\n\nWhen asked to convince people why they should see her speech, she turned to the camera and practically screamed, saying, \"It is an existential threat! Do you care about climate change? Do you care about the future for you, for your children?\"\n\nShe continued, \"Do you want to know how we can solve it through cool technology? I’ve got a very snappy Prezi [presentation] that I’m going to be doing. How can anybody turn that down? So come to my speech.\"\n\nBIDEN ADMIN CRACKS DOWN ON WASHERS, FRIDGES IN LATEST CLIMATE ACTION: 'OVERREGULATION ON STEROIDS'\n\nGranholm ended her pitch with a sheepish chuckle, as Ali jokingly asked his producers in the room, \"You all convinced?\" A couple of sleepy affirmations could be heard off camera which prompted both Granholm and the host to cheer wildly.\n\nWith her hands outstretched, Granholm bellowed, \"The throngs!\" and then burst out into laughter. The interview then ended as Ali shook her hand and thanked her.\n\nSome Twitter users seemed to find the clip ridiculous.\n\nAnti-climate agenda activist group \"Climate Dispatch\" ripped Granholm, saying, \"She has no idea what she's doing or saying. She's the Buttigieg of energy.\"\n\nThe North Carolina GOP’s Twitter claimed Granholm was an actor performing a bit for the leftist agenda. It tweeted, \"All the world's a stage... @SecGranholm here, playing her part.\"\n\nConservative radio host Joe Pagliarulo insisted that Granholm wasn’t being herself in this clip. He tweeted, \"When @JenGranholm was the AG of Michigan and I interviewed her many times -- she was NOT like this. What is this act? And, what exactly are her credentials to be the energy secretary?\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nConservative Influencer account \"IT GUY\" added that Granholm is \"Greta in about 40 years,\" referring to Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg.",

During the interview, Granholm discussed issues pertaining to climate change and the U.S.'s foray into clean energy production. She then demanded to know if Americans even care about the future or their children. When asked to convince people why they should see her speech, she turned to the camera and practically screamed, \"It is an existential threat!\" and then ended her pitch with a sheepish chuckle. Anti-climate agenda activist group \"Climate Dispatch\" ripped Granholm, saying, \"She has no idea what she's doing or saying.\" Conservative radio host Joe Pagliarulo insisted that Granholm wasn't being herself in this clip.",

            "description": "President Biden gave a chilling warning to younger generations about their future because of climate change during a Monday interview on 'The Daily Show.'",
            "content": "President Biden gave a dire warning about the future while talking about climate change in a new interview.\n\nWhile a guest on \"The Daily Show,\" Biden told former Obama aide Kal Penn that young people between 18 and 35 years old motivated him to sign off on the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\n\"They had enough of it,\" Biden recalled, suggesting they \"showed up\" to vote in the last two elections out of concerns over the environment.\n\nBIDEN SAYS CLIMATE CHANGE IS BIGGER THREAT TO HUMANITY THAN NUCLEAR WAR: ‘WE’RE GOING TO HAVE A REAL PROBLEM'\n\nBiden argued that \"Mother Nature\" was angry at how humans have treated the earth, saying he's seen more extreme weather and forest fires since he took office.\n\n\"What happened was Mother Nature let her wrath be seen in the last two years,\" he said. \"So people can’t deny it anymore.\"\n\nThe president warned younger generations would have no future to look forward to if we didn't act on climate change.\n\n\"If we don't keep the temperature from going above 1.5 degrees Celsius, raised then we're in real trouble. That whole generation is damned. That’s not hyperbole. Really truly in trouble,\" he claimed.\n\nEarlier this year, the Democratic president said climate change was a bigger threat to humanity than nuclear war.\n\n\"If we don’t stay under 1.5 degrees Celsius, we’re going to have a real problem. It’s the single-most existential threat to humanity we’ve ever faced, including nuclear weapons,\" Biden said during a Democratic National Committee fundraiser.\n\nBiden touted how he had urged automakers to go electric as part of his climate change plan. \"Within five weeks [of our meeting] all of them agreed they were going to go electric,\" he told Penn.\n\nIn 2021, Biden signed an Executive Order requiring half of all new auto sales in 2030 be electric vehicles.\n\nFox News first reported on Monday that a leaked memo from the Biden administration admitted charging fossil fuel companies less to drill would provide the country \"greater energy security.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDespite this, the White House still planned to raise royalty fees for an oil and gas lease sale off the coast of Alaska as part of Biden's climate change agenda.",

Biden also touted how he had urged automakers to go electric as part of his climate change plan, and signed an Executive Order requiring half of all new auto sales in 2030 be electric vehicles. Fox News first reported on Monday that a leaked memo from the Biden administration admitted charging fossil fuel companies less to drill would provide the country \"greater energy security.\"",

            "content": "A Colorado city is considering a resolution that would ban new gas stations and automobile service stations to combat climate change.\n\nThe proposed ordinance before the city council restricts the number of gas stations and service stations for Louisville, Colorado, to six, with a seventh being permitted only if it's part of a large retail center.\n\n\"We have an obligation to take every step possible to address the changes to our climate that are ravaging our planet and directly impacting the health, well-being and livelihoods of the constituents we represent in Louisville,\" Councilmember Maxine Most told Fox News.\n\nHOW CLIMATE ALARMISM IS MAKING PEOPLE CHILDLESS BY CHOICE:\n\nThe city council document including the ordinance defines automobile service stations as a business \"engaged in the sale of motor fuels and in supplying goods and services generally required in the operation and maintenance of automotive vehicles and the fulfilling of motorists' needs.\" It adds that \"major automotive repairs, painting, body and fender work are prohibited.\"\n\nNew gas stations and service stations will also be required to have at least two charging stations for electric vehicles and be 1,000 feet away from existing stations unless it's part of a large retail center, according to the ordinance.\n\nLouisville, a Denver suburb with about 21,000 residents, currently has five gas stations with a sixth recently approved for construction.\n\nSERIAL GAS STOVE USER STACEY ABRAMS TROLLED FOR JOINING GROUP THAT WANTS TO BAN THEM\n\nThe Louisville Sustainability Advisory Board reviewed the proposal earlier this month, recommending that the ordinance reduce the number of stations to five and remove the exception for an additional station for a large retailer.\n\nLimiting stations is a growing trend for local municipalities \"due to health and environmental concerns with the continued use of gasoline powered vehicles and equipment,\" the document's analysis section states.\n\nIt points to California municipalities that have as passing similar restrictions, like Petaluma, Santa Rosa and Sonoma County.\n\nUN REPORT PREDICTING CLIMATE CATASTROPHE IN 2030 MET WITH MOCKERY: 'EVERY SINGLE PREDICTION' HAS BEEN 'WRONG'\n\n\"Gasoline station bans may also be seen as promoting the use of Electric Vehicles (EVs), thus, reducing vehicle emissions and encouraging low-carbon and cleaner energy options for transportation,\" the ordinance adds.\n\nIt lays out goals for Louisville such as meeting the city’s municipal electricity needs with carbon-free sources by 2025, generating 75% of the city’s residential, commercial and industrial electric needs with carbon-free sources by 2030 and reducing greenhouse emissions.\n\nUTAH SCHOOL GIVES KIDS 'DISGUSTING' INSECTS TO EAT IN CLASS FOR CLIMATE ASSIGNMENT ON COWS KILLING THE EARTH\n\n\"The proposal for a cap but not a full ban on new gasoline and automobile service stations is in recognition that there will continue to be some demand for gasoline and automobile service stations as more EVs enter the market and gasoline vehicles are transitioned out of the market over time,\" the document adds.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLast year, the city council passed an emergency moratorium to ban the construction of new gas stations until September 2023.\n\nThere are 9,840 electric vehicles in Boulder County, where Louisville is located, according to .",

            "description": "Sophia Kianni, an youth climate activist recently hired by the United Nations as an adviser, is calling for governments to implement pandemic measures to fight global warming.",
            "content": "A youth United Nations (UN) climate adviser is calling for world leaders to treat global warming with the same mandates used to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSophia Kianni, who is the UN's youngest adviser, said in a tweet earlier this week that more than 80% of the global population is being \"impacted\" by climate change and that it warranted an emergency response.\n\n\"Remember when we treated COVID-19 like an emergency?\" Kianni tweeted Monday evening. \"Well it’s time to do the same for climate change, over 80% of the world's population is being impacted from Climate Change!\"\n\nAmid the COVID-19 pandemic, governments implemented wide-reaching mandates and economic shutdowns, which led to massive job losses and supply chain problems, in an effort to prevent further spread of the disease. Such shutdowns were heavily criticized for their negative impacts on the global economy and education outcomes.\n\nGOP OPENS INVESTIGATION INTO BIDEN ADMIN FOR OBSTRUCTING US ENERGY PRODUCERS WITH 'RADICAL ECO-AGENDA'\n\nHowever, actions taken to defeat the pandemic — such as limiting travel and forcing individuals to stay at home — ultimately curbed carbon emissions and energy consumption, a priority activists have pushed. In 2020, the U.S. emitted 4.6 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide, a staggering 11% year-over-year decline and the lowest level since 1983, according to federal data.\n\n\"If we can think about how to prepare for climate change like a pandemic, maybe there will be a positive outcome to all of this,\" CoolClimate Network developer Christopher Jones told NBC News in 2020 amid COVID-19 shutdowns. \"We can help prevent crises in the future if we are prepared. I think there are some big-picture lessons here that could be very useful.\"\n\n\"This is a huge opportunity for countries that import fossil fuels which can save trillions of dollars by switching to a clean energy economy in line with the Paris Agreement,\" energy strategist Kingsmill Bond added months later. \"Now is the time to plan an orderly wind-down of fossil fuel assets and manage the impact on the global economy rather than try to sustain the unsustainable.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nKianni, who is also the founder of the international climate group Climate Cardinals, meanwhile, made headlines last year after she delivered remarks at the UN annual climate conference in Egypt. During the speech, she blasted world leaders for continuing to allow new oil and gas leasing, calling for more aggressive actions to combat global warming.",

Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., slammed President Biden's stance on energy, arguing he is \"held hostage\" by the \"high priest of climate change John Kerry\" as he endures growing calls to bolster domestic energy production. Gallagher joined \"The Faulkner Focus\" Wednesday to discuss the White House approach to energy as they continue to pin blame on soaring gas prices on the Russian invasion into Ukraine.\n\nRICK PERRY: BIDEN'S POLICIES WILL CONTINUE TO DRIVE UP THE COST OF LIVING IN AMERICA\n\nMIKE GALLAGHER: If you add on to this absurdity with Russia, the fact that this administration is contemplating reviving the Iran deal, well, they may start to justify that by saying we need to bring Iranian crude onto the international market. Don't pay attention to the fact that they're the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism. They're close to getting a nuclear weapon. And oh, by the way, they win in this deal, Russia wins and China wins in an Iran deal. It makes absolutely no sense, and a fatal flaw in their approach is that the administration is still being held hostage by the climate change lobby led by the high priest of climate change, John Kerry, and it's undermining our national security.\n\nWATCH INTERVIEW FROM \"THE FAULKNER FOCUS\" BELOW:",

You have a war, and obviously you’re going to have massive emissions consequences to the war. But equally importantly, you're going to lose people's focus, you're going to lose certainly big country attention because they will be diverted, and I think it could have a damaging impact,\" Kerry said, adding that he hopes Russian President Vladimir Putin will help the world \"stay on track\" with fighting climate change.\n\nKerry said Wednesday that while the refugee crisis in Ukraine was a big problem as Russia continues to invade Ukraine, he warned migration would be worse if climate change is not addressed.\n\n\"If you think migration has been a problem in Europe in the Syrian War or even from what we see now, wait until you see 100 million people for whom the entire food production capacity has collapsed,\" he said during a speech at the CERAweek conference in Houston, Texas.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",

            "description": "USA Today sports writer Dan Wolken argued that the college football season schedule needs to be changed in order to handle the dangers of climate change.",
            "content": "USA Today Sports columnist Dan Wolken claimed that a new college football season schedule needs to be dreamed up in order to handle the threat of climate change.\n\nIn response to a Wednesday ESPN article exploring whether a reimagined college football season calendar could be a good idea, Wolken tweeted that \"extreme heat\" and \"climate change\" make this idea completely necessary.\n\nThe ESPN article in question polled \"decision-makers\" within the sport and \"those who would be directly impacted\" weigh the \"pros and cons of such theoretical changes.\"\n\nRegardless of his actual decision-making relevance with the college football world, Wolken gave a ringing endorsement to shifting the schedule around in order to deal with climate change on Thursday.\n\nSharing Sports Illustrated writer Pat Forde’s tweet about the article – in which the journo mentioned the article has \"some good\" and \"some unrealistic\" ideas – Wolken commented that climate change should prompt administrators to change the schedule.\n\nHe wrote, \"If you want to actually reimagine the college football calendar, I’d start with the reality that extreme heat and climate change is going to have a major impact.\"\n\nWolken also threw a passive-aggressive insult at the people who could make these scheduling changes, adding that actually making these changes for the climate \"that would require vision and college athletics administrators really don’t do that.\"\n\nTaking Wolken seriously, Forde responded to his comment, tweeting, \"Fair point.\"\n\nPreviously, Wolken advocated that the college football schedule be altered on account of the threat of coronavirus.\n\nIn another passive-aggressive tweet from 2020 meant to shame the SEC commissioner, Wolken wrote, \"In response to a question about what would constitute a successful season, SEC commissioner Greg Sankey said ‘Naming an SEC champion this year’ in Atlanta on Dec. 19. No comment on health and safety of participants.\"\n\nCNN’S BASH BLAMES WAGE GAP FOR GRINER ARREST, CLAIMS PLAYER WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN IN RUSSIA IF WNBA PAID LIKE NBA\n\nThese types of statements have also earned Wolken, and other journalists pushing for sports to be suspended due to COVID-19, the colloquial nickname \"coronabro\" from others in sports media.\n\nForde has a history of being a \"coronabro\" as well. In 2021, he tweeted, \"Not saying this is a causal relationship, but: the three coaches who seemed the least interested in wearing their masks this season were Brad Underwood, Bob Huggins and Chris Beard. Gone, gone, gone.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",

            "description": "Democrat Minnesota AG ripped by GOP challenger for 'frivolous' climate change suit amid soaring violent crime",
            "content": "Democratic Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison is facing criticism from his Republican challenger for prioritizing a climate change lawsuit over tackling violent crime fallout since George Floyd’s killing.\n\nJim Schultz, who recently won the GOP attorney general primary earlier this month, has made criticizing Ellison’s lawsuit aimed at holding fossil fuel firms accountable for allegedly deceiving the public on climate change an issue on his campaign while vying to take over the helm as the state’s top prosecutor.\n\nIn a recent interview with the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, Schultz described litigation spearheaded by the Democratic state attorney general as \"frivolous,\" arguing that it has \"zero chance of succeeding\" and is \"fundamentally motivated by headlines and pleasing one side of the political aisle.\"\n\n\"The Attorney General's Office is not supposed to be engaging in far-left political activism, or activism of any kind,\" the Republican candidate said. \"I will not engage in things like this that are fundamentally about business harassment.\"\n\nFBI ARRESTS TENNESSEE REPUBLICAN LAWMAKER, FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF OVER ALLEGED BRIBERY AND KICKBACK CONSPIRACY\n\nSchultz argued Ellison should instead focus on hiring more prosecutors tasked with addressing violent crime that has been soaring statewide since Minneapolis erupted in violent demonstrations and became the epicenter of the defund the police movement in reaction to the police killing of Floyd in 2020.\n\nAccording to the Minnesota Department of Public Safety Bureau of Criminal Apprehension’s 2021 uniform crime report released on Aug. 12, the state saw a 21.6% increase in violent crime last year.\n\nViolent crime in greater Minnesota rose by 16% in 2021. In the seven-county metro area – comprised of Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott and Washington counties – violent crime rose by 23.9%, according to the annual report. Motor vehicle thefts statewide were at the highest since 2001.\n\nEllison’s lawsuit filed in 2020 alleges that American Petroleum Institute, ExxonMobil and Koch Industries misled Minnesota consumers for years about the alleged consequences of burning oil and gas in making the planet hotter, arguing that the state \"has already experienced billions of dollars of economic harm due to climate change\" and \"will continue to suffer billions of dollars of damage through midcentury.\"\n\n\"This lawsuit is in the long and successful tradition of Minnesota attorneys general standing up to protect Minnesotans from corporate fraud and deception by Big Tobacco, Big Pharma, and now Big Oil,\" Ellison said in a statement emailed to the Tribune. \"This is what Minnesotans expect from their attorney general. It's the right fight to be having.\"\n\n\"ExxonMobil, Koch Industries, and the American Petroleum Institute knew for decades their industries were a major source of climate change and were causing Minnesotans long-term harm,\" Ellison added.\n\nThe litigation, currently in limbo in the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, is among more than 20 other similar suits from cities, counties and states nationwide targeting fossil fuel firms over climate change.\n\nIn statements obtained by the Tribune, an ExxonMobil spokesman said Ellison’s lawsuit was \"a waste of millions of dollars of taxpayer money\" and does nothing to reduce the risks of climate change.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAn API spokeswoman argued that over the past two decades, the fossil fuel industry \"has achieved its goal of providing affordable, reliable American energy to U.S. consumers while substantially reducing emissions.\" A spokesman for Flint Hills said that the firm strongly disputes \"any allegation that our company has ever been deceptive or dishonest with respect to the issue of the changing climate.\"",

            "description": "Hurricane Ian: CNN, MSNBC, ABC, CBS, NBC tout climate change more than 600 times in coverage",
            "content": "Climate change was a central topic of conversation throughout on-air coverage of Hurricane Ian, with the phrase mentioned across CNN, MSNBC, ABC, CBS, and NBC more than 600 times in a one-week period.\n\nA review of transcripts by Fox News Digital found that CNN accounted for the largest chunk of climate change mentions, with the phrase uttered 311 times between Sept. 26 and Oct. 2.\n\nMSNBC was not far behind, with climate change getting mentioned in coverage of the hurricane 212 times, mostly during primetime shows.\n\nFor their part, CBS News made note of climate change 61 times, while ABC News echoed the phrase 27 times, and NBC News 23 times.\n\nDEMOCRATS BLAMING CLIMATE CHANGE FOR HURRICANE IAN AT ODDS WITH SCIENCE, EXPERTS SAY\n\nThe vast majority of these instances saw hosts, reporters and guests state that climate change was causing oceans to warm, and thus were exacerbating and intensifying major natural disasters, including forest fires and storms such as hurricanes.\n\nMSNBC’s \"The ReidOut\" host Joy Reid in particular took ample time last Wednesday to discuss climate change with fellow network anchor Ali Velshi.\n\nAs Velshi reported on the impact of the storm live, Reid claimed that global warming had allowed hurricanes to \"thrive.\"\n\n\"There is a lot that has changed about the earth that has made these things worse, right? These things are thriving because the water is getting warmer. We stopped calling it global warming for political reasons, but that’s what it is. Our earth is getting warmer and there’s just no doubt, I think, left that it is feeding these beasts,\" Reid said.\n\nOne of the network’s meteorologists, Michelle Grossman, also discussed climate change in the context of Hurricane Ian. On Friday, \"Morning Joe\" co-anchor Willie Geist asked her whether, in her experience, Ian’s move from one body of water to another was unusual for a storm near Florida’s coast.\n\nPOLITIFACT RUSHES TO DEFEND HARRIS AFTER VP'S CONTROVERSIAL 'EQUITY' COMMENTS ABOUT HURRICANE RELIEF\n\n\"You know, we’ve seen so many rarities this season. We’ve seen storms go from the Atlantic to the Pacific, back to the Atlantic. With this storm, you know, I think what stood out, it stood out as a weak storm and then just rapidly intensified. We don’t see that often and that is a connection with climate change,\" Grossman said.\n\nIn a separate segment, \"Morning Joe\" co-host Mika Brzezinski took it a step further and claimed that Hurricane Ian was the result of \"human-caused\" climate change.\n\nOn CNN, host Don Lemon was shut down by acting director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Hurricane Center on Tuesday after he asked about the effect climate change had on Hurricane Ian.\n\nLemon noted that meteorologists have said Hurricane Ian could enter \"another period of rapid intensification\" and asked Jamie Rhome what effect climate change has had on the \"phenomena.\"\n\nRhome replied they could come back to a discussion on climate change another time and claimed that rapid intensification was likely almost done. Lemon, appearing to be unsatisfied with the answer, again pressed Rhome on what effect climate change could have on the phenomena.\n\n\"I don’t think you can link climate change to any one event. On the whole, on the cumulative, climate change may be making storms worse. But to link it to any one event, I would caution against that,\" Rhome said.\n\nCNN'S AVLON CLAIMS FLORIDA 'NEEDS' MIGRANTS TO HELP HURRICANE CLEANUP, RIPS GOP 'HYPOCRISY' ON IMMIGRATION\n\nHurricane Ian slammed into southwest Florida as a Category 4 storm on Wednesday, causing more than a million residents to lose power and prompting stark safety warnings from Florida officials.\n\nThe claim that Hurricane Ian was in part or in whole the result of climate change has also popped up in recent days in print articles scattered across the internet.\n\nMedia outlets, including the New York Times, Associated Press, Politico, NPR and Axios, have published news stories reporting that climate change is to blame for Hurricane Ian and the storm's rapid intensification. A recent Time magazine article said the \"science is well known\" that climate change created the conditions for Hurricane Ian.\n\nMajor liberal media networks have frequently blamed a number of natural disasters on climate change in the last several years.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn February 2021, following a winter storm that caused widespread power outages for 4 million Texans that left almost 100 dead, major media outlets such as MSNBC, The Washington Post and CNN blamed the issue on climate change and called for a number of radical environmental policies. Similar on-air conversations and print pieces cropped up following California’s recent electrical grid issues, which were frequently blamed on climate change-induced wildfires.\n\nFox News’ Thomas Catenacci and Hanna Panreck contributed to this report.",

            "title": "The top issues liberal media outlets have blamed on climate change, from ISIS to hate speech",
            "description": "The New York Times, Washington Post, National Geographic and more attempted to blame climate change for a variety of issues, including terrorism and crime.",
            "content": "Liberal media outlets have long been infatuated with doomsday predictions about climate change, with journalists blaming a wide variety of sociopolitical issues, like hate speech and terrorism for the ongoing increase in global average temperature.\n\nDemocrats and their cohorts in the media in the media have often blamed major hurricanes, tornadoes, and other extreme weather events on climate change. But, their dire warning about the issue have also led them to blame more unconventional problems on changes to our global climate.\n\nEffect of climate change on babies in the womb\n\nA New York Times opinion piece released last week claimed that babies in the womb can be negatively impacted by climate change, citing a study published in The Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry. The study compared babies in utero during the storm, versus kids who were born or conceived after the storm. According to Times opinion writer Jessica Grose, the study found higher rates of psychological issues among kids who lived through the hurricane while inside the womb.\n\n\"The study’s authors found that boys who were exposed to Sandy in the womb had elevated risks for \"attention-deficit/disruptive behavioral disorders,\" while girls had elevated risks for anxiety disorders, depressive disorders and phobias,\" Grose wrote.\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE EFFECTS 'CAN BEGIN IN THE WOMB' WARNS NEW YORK TIMES OPINION PIECE, PUSHES FOR GOVT. ACTION\n\nThe writer suggested that extensive climate legislation, much larger than the Inflation Reduction Act, was needed to combat the issue, based off the idea that climate change would continue to increase the severity and frequency of severe weather events, thus impacting pregnant women.\n\nPossible link between climate change and ‘hate speech’\n\nA week earlier, a Washington Post article claimed that climate change was leading to a rise in \"hate speech\" incidences, spurred by hotter temperatures across the globe.\n\nIn an October 13 report, titled, \"Hotter days bring out hotter tempers, research finds,\" weather reporter Amudalat Ajasa cited two studies that show that because of climate change, extreme temperatures are inducing people to engage in \"hate speech and hostile behavior.\"\n\nAccording to the one of the studies, \"hate speech on social media escalated with high temperatures.\" The other found that there was \"an increase in workplace harassment and discrimination at the U.S. Postal Service when the temperature eclipsed 90 degrees.\"\n\nDelving more specifically into the data, the reporter cited the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research’s study, which found an \"increase of hate speech of up to 22 percent on Twitter when temperatures are above 107 degrees Fahrenheit.\" Not only that, but \"extreme cold\" coincided with a rise in \"offensive tweets.\"\n\nAjasa claimed that scientists made these findings by using \"a machine-learning algorithm to analyze 75 million hate tweets from a database containing over 4 billion tweets posted by people across the United States between 2014 and 2020. The algorithm showed that aggressive behavior was the tamest between 54 and 70 degrees.\n\nMedia publications’ habit of blaming climate change as the catalyst for numerous negative outcomes.\n\nCo-host Nate Burleson introduced the study published in the journal \"Temperature\" that argued \"climate change, specifically warmer temperatures is making our children more inactive and more obese.\"\n\nBurleson said the study found that children were 30% less \"aerobically fit\" than their parents and claimed hotter temperatures were preventing kids from exercising outside.\n\nClimate change helped to strengthen ISIS, The Taliban, and more\n\nA year earlier, CBS News released a report that claimed climate change had helped strengthen the Taliban. In the report titled \"How climate change helped strengthen the Taliban,\" CBS News' climate and energy reporter Cara Korte highlighted that \"rural Afghanistan\" has been \"rocked by climate change,\" and said the Taliban has \"taken advantage\" of those who have suffered from floods and droughts that have destroyed their crops and left them hungry.\n\nThe report also made note of the impact of climate change on an increase in floods in the winter, caused by the melting of snow and glaciers in the country’s northern mountains. Furthermore, the report noted that rain had increased in south and west of Afghanistan by 10-25% over the past 30 years. Such flooding had allegedly led Taliban forces to exploit and recruit Afghan farmers, who are told they could make up their lost profits by joining the group.\n\nIn recent years, concerns over how climate change could fuel conflicts have gained traction. National Geographic, in particular, often floated the idea that extreme weather, such as droughts and storms, could exacerbate economic and political turmoil in destabilizing regions.\n\nOn at least three separate occasions, National Geographic floated a similar theory in regard to ISIS recruitment in Iraq, a lack of peace in Afghanistan, and the Syrian War.\n\nTwo years ago in 2020, the magazine released an article titled \"In Afghanistan, climate change complicates future prospects for peace.\" Alleging that Afghanistan is one of the most vulnerable, and least equipped countries in the world to handle climate change, the papers consulted experts warned that climate change would fuel natural disasters, leading to mass displacement, child marriage, and violence.\n\nIn November 2018, National Geographic published a piece entitled \"Climate change and water woes drove ISIS Recruiting in Iraq.\" The piece claimed that shifting resources, and desperate farmers were \"driven into terror recruiters’ clutches,\" and questioned whether such a scenario could happen again, or become worse in the future.\n\nJust a year earlier the magazine said the refugee crisis facing the European Union could become far worse as climate change wreaks havoc on Syria, and other Eastern Mediterranean countries.\n\n\"As warming worsens, these influxes would accelerate. Under one scenario where warming stabilizes by 2100, asylum applications could increase by some 28 percent. But in a scenario with \"business-as-usual\" warming, applications could nearly triple, to more than a million asylum seekers per yea,\" the report stated.\n\nIn a 2015 report, the magazine linked a number of droughts in Syria and South Sudan to climate change, and claimed that it had made the Syrian Civil War worse.\n\n\"Drought, worsened by climate change, led to mass migration that helped spark the Syrian conflict, researchers say,\" the report said in part.\n\nDEMOCRATS BLAMING CLIMATE CHANGE FOR HURRICANE IAN AT ODDS WITH SCIENCE, EXPERTS SAY\n\nClimate change will cause murders, rapes, and assaults to rise: MSNBC guest\n\nThe possible link between violence and climate change was also discussed by MSNBC’s \"Morning Joe\" panel back in 2019.\n\nAt the time, journalist and author David Wallace-Wells claimed that there was a direct correlation between rising temperatures and conflict on the planet.\n\n\"For every half a degree of warming we’re expected to see a 10 or 20% increase in conflicts. So if we get to where we’re going by the end of the century, we could have twice as much war as we have today. And that conflict happens even at the individual levels, so we’ll see rises in murder rates and rape, domestic assault. It spikes the rates at which people are admitted to mental hospitals,\" Wallace-Wells said.\n\nScreenwriter says climate change could cause real life ‘sharknado’\n\nConversations about climate change have even cropped up in media interviews related to popular entertainment. Such was the case in 2014 in a conversation between anchor Tamron Hall and screenwriter Thunder Levin.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDuring the interview, Hall asked Levin how he and his colleagues came up with a story as original \"Sharknado,\" to which Levin said that it was time to alert the world the perils of global warming and \"biomediaology,\" and getting facts out to everyone.\n\n\"Because this can happen,\" Hall laughed.\n\n\"Absolutely it can happen,\" Levin replied. It was unclear during the interview if the \"Sharknado\" creator was serious about his comments.",

            "title": "Biden torched for climate change tweet vowing 'cleaner air,' 'safer water' amid Ohio train derailment fallout",
            "description": "President Biden was ripped by Twitter users for a \"tone deaf\" tweet promising clear air and water as a result of climate change investments amid the Ohio train derailment fallout.",
            "content": "President Biden was panned for a tweet Tuesday promising that climate investments will ensure \"our kids will breathe cleaner air\" as his administration’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is under fire for its handling of the Ohio train derailment and health concerns over toxic chemicals mounting.\n\n\"Because of our climate investments, our kids will breathe cleaner air, drink safer water, and get to school powered by clean energy,\" Biden tweeted Tuesday morning. The president added, \"That’s the future we’re building,\" tapping EPA Administrator Michael Regan, \"let’s finish the job.\"\n\nTwitter users, however, accused the timing of the tweet of being \"tone deaf,\" as concerned residents who live miles away from the East Palestine, Ohio, train derailment are telling local news outlets that they’re still smelling lingering odors in the atmosphere. Some reported developing worsening coughs. Others expressed fears of drinking or bathing in the water coming from their faucets despite water utilities across state lines in West Virginia taking precautions and local officials assuring it’s safe.\n\nOne resident of North Lima, more than 10 miles from East Palestine, told WKBN-TV that her five hens and rooster mysteriously slowed before ultimately dropping dead this week, spurring fears among other animal owners that livestock might be exposed to chemicals through the air, water and soil.\n\nOHIO TRAIN DERAILMENT PROMPTS WATER UTILITY ACROSS STATE LINES TO TAKE PRECAUTIONS AS HEALTH CONCERNS MOUNT\n\n\"Not in Ohio,\" one Twitter wrote, replying to Biden's tweet.\n\n\"Does Ohio not exist to this guy? Extremely poor timing to talk about the climate,\" another user added.\n\n\"The audacity of this statement considering what’s going on in Ohio and it’s [sic] surrounding states. Yet, once again, Biden remains mum on the subject,\" a third wrote.\n\nIn a Feb. 10 letter, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency notified Norfolk Southern Railway Company of the threat of additional pollutants or contaminants released into the environment from the East Palestine derailment site. In addition to vinyl chloride, the chemical widely reported after the controlled release, the letter said multiple rail cars and tankers were observed derailed, breached, and/or on fire, that included but were not limited to ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, ethylhexyl acrylate, isobutylene, and butyl acrylate.\n\nThe EPA admitted, \"vinyl chloride, butyl acrylate, ethylhexyl acrylate, and ethylene glycol monobutyl ether are known to have been and continue to be released to the air, surface soils, and surface waters.\" Also of concern are phosgene gas and hydrogen chloride, which the EPA detected in air monitoring.\n\nOne outraged Twitter user noted that phosgene gas was used as a \"choking agent\" in World War I, condemning Biden as a \"blight on humanity.\"\n\n\"This idiot nuked Ohio. And he wants to talk about clean air?\" another user wrote.\n\nAt approximately 8:55 p.m. on Feb. 3, about 50 of a Norfolk Southern train’s 150 cars derailed in East Palestine, an Ohio village of some 4,700 residents about 50 miles northwest of Pittsburgh. The EPA confirmed approximately 20 of those rail cars were listed as carrying hazardous materials. Residents on both sides of the Ohio-Pennsylvania border were ordered to evacuate amid fears of a possible explosion as a fire sent smoke billowing into the air.\n\nThree days later, authorities held a controlled release of the chemicals.\n\nFive rail car tankers of vinyl chloride were intentionally breached, and the chemical was diverted to an excavated trench and then burned off. The EPA said areas of contaminated soil and free liquids were observed and potentially covered and/or filled during reconstruction of the rail line, including portions of the burn pit.\n\nOn Feb. 8, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine told residents they could return home and air quality samples in the area were showing readings below safety screening levels for contaminants. As of Monday, the EPA said 291 homes have been screened and no detections of vinyl chloride or hydrogen chloride were identified to date. There were 181 homes that remain to be screened.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOn Tuesday, Biden’s official account shared a Jan. 10 video from Regan during a visit to Bucyrus, Kansas, following the president’s State of the Union address. While there, Regan says he took a ride on the first-ever electric school bus in Kansas thanks to the EPA’s Clean School Buses Program.\n\nHe also shows drones in the skies at Guetterman Brothers Family Farms, saying he was \"looking how advanced technology will usher in clean tech and combat the climate crisis.\"\n\n\"And thanks to President Biden’s leadership, we are delivering on the president’s promise to invest in America and rural Americans would not be left behind,\" Regan adds.",

            "description": "Governments should consider imposing World War II-style policies of rationing on food, fuel, and other goods in order to fight climate change, according to a new academic paper.",
            "content": "Governments should consider imposing World War II-style policies of rationing on goods such as food, fuel, and clothing in order to fight climate change, according to a newly published academic paper.\n\nResearchers at the University of Leeds, a top British institution, write in the journal Ethics, Policy & Environment that rationing has been wrongfully \"neglected\" as a policy option for mitigating climate change, arguing such an approach would be more effective than the \"slow and inequitable\" results from tax hikes to promote a green agenda.\n\n\"We argue that rationing could help states reduce emissions rapidly and fairly,\" the academic paper states. \"Our arguments in this paper draw on economic analysis and historical research into rationing in the UK during (and after) the two world wars, highlighting success stories and correcting misconceptions.\"\n\nThe authors add that the \"rejection of markets, and a commitment to fair shares, is a key part of the value of rationing, and precisely what made rationing attractive to the public in the 1940s.\"\n\nHOW A FIRST-GENERATION RANCHER USES INSTAGRAM TO DISPEL 'PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS' ABOUT BEEF PRODUCTION\n\nSpecifically, governments could ration various goods, such as flights, petrol, household energy, and even meat or clothing, according to the paper, which also suggests limiting \"the number of long-haul flights an individual could make in a year\" or \"the amount of petrol one can buy in a month.\"\n\nAnother way to roll out the rationing scheme could be \"carbon cards\" to track one's \"carbon allowance.\"\n\nSuch an idea isn't new. Last year, the president of Alibaba Group, a major Chinese tech company, boasted at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting about the development of an \"individual carbon footprint tracker\" that will be able to track where people travel, how they travel, and what they eat.\n\nThe academics pointed to World War II as a model for rationing supplies to the public, claiming that while a rationing system is perceived as unattractive, many who experienced it didn't have a negative experience.\n\n\"It is important to emphasize the difference between rationing itself and the scarcity that rationing was a response to,\" the paper states. \"Of course, people did welcome the end of rationing, but they were really celebrating the end of scarcity, and celebrating the fact that rationing was no longer necessary.\"\n\nA problem with rationing energy, the researchers note, is people might not be as willing to accept it as they would if resources were scarce, because they know there's an \"abundance of resources available.\"\n\nThey suggest therefore regulating fossil fuels through limitations on activities such as oil exploration, long-haul flights, and intensive farming to create a scarcity in products that harm the planet. Then rationing could be introduced gradually to manage the subsequent scarcity.\n\nCritics quickly decried the paper's suggestions as extreme and unpalatable.\n\n\"Academics propose the rationing to combat climate change!\" tweeted Nigel Farage, a British broadcaster and former politician. \"Flights, meat, petrol and even clothing should have a non-transferable token, tracked by a 'carbon card' instead of bank card. Worst part is these crackpot ideas will soon be mainstream.\"\n\nThe researchers didn't immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. However, the paper's two lead authors provided statements to British press outlets.\n\n\"There is a limit to how much we can emit if we are to reduce the catastrophic impacts of climate change. In this sense, the scarcity is very real,\" said Rob Lawlor.\n\nFellow lead author Nathan Wood said, \"The concept of rationing could help, not only in the mitigation of climate change, but also in reference to a variety of other social and political issues — such as the current energy crisis.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSome supermarkets in Britain have already begun rationing fruits and vegetables amid soaring energy costs, which have devastated some farmers.",

            "content": "Nevada state lawmakers are considering a plan to give water authorities the power to limit the amount of water available for residential use.\n\n\"It’s a worst case scenario plan,\" Democratic Assemblyman Howard Watts of Las Vegas, one of the bill's sponsors, told the Associated Press. \"It makes sure that we prioritize the must-haves for a home. Your drinking water, your basic health and safety needs.\"\n\nLawmakers will gather to discuss the sweeping change, which would grant the Southern Nevada Water Authority the ability to cap residential water use in single-family homes to 160,000 gallons per year, on Monday.\n\nProponents of the bill argue that drought, climate change and a surge in demand have contributed to the deepening problem, with key Colorado River reservoirs that Nevada and six other states depending on seeing their water levels shrink to all-time lows. The Las Vegas area gets 90% of its water from the Colorado River.\n\nRules limiting the use of water are nothing new to Nevada residents, who saw an 8% reduction of their supply of Colorado River water after recent mandatory cuts. Many residents have yet to feel the pinch of the shrinking supply, in large part because the Southern Nevada Water Authority recycles much of the water used indoors and prevents the state from using its full allotment.\n\nNevada lawmakers have also recently banned ornamental grass at office parks, in street medians and entrances to housing developments, while Clark County capped the size of new swimming pools at single-family residential homes.\n\nBut a state law granting the water authority more power would carry more force than local ordinances, proponents say, causing more jurisdictions that rely on the Colorado River elsewhere to make cuts to their use.\n\nBronson Mack, a spokesperson for the Southern Nevada Water Authority, told the Associated Press that the authority has not yet made a plan for how it would implement or enforce the new limits, while cautioning that passing the bill would not automatically go into effect.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe agency also noted that the average home uses about 130,000 gallons of water annually, meaning the largest users of water would most feel the pinch from a 160,000-gallon cap.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

The bill would grant the Southern Nevada Water Authority more power than local ordinances, and would require residents to reduce their water consumption by 8% after recent mandatory cuts. Proponents argue that drought, climate change and a surge in demand have contributed to the problem, with key Colorado River reservoirs that Nevada and six other states depending on seeing their water levels shrink to all-time lows. The average home uses about 130,000 gallon of water annually, meaning the largest users of water would most feel the pinch from a 160, thousand-gallon cap. The Southern Nevada water Authority has not yet made a plan for how it would implement or enforce the new limits, while cautioning that passing the bill would not automatically go into effect.",

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, \"55% of China’s energy\" now comes from coal \"compared to 11% in the U.S.\"\n\nThe Department of Energy declined to respond to a request for comment for this story.",

            "content": "The Atlantic was mocked by political commentators for showing concern about how a nuclear war would affect the climate. Reacting Tuesday to the piece on \"Fox & Friends,\" Hoover Institute fellow Bjorn Lomborg said that he was \"astounded\" by the argument.\n\nThe Atlantic headline on Sunday argued, in addition to killing millions of people, a nuclear war would \"prove disastrous for climate change.\"\n\n\"On Top of Everything Else, Nuclear War Is a Climate Problem,\" the headline of The Atlantic article read. \"A nuclear war would kill tens of millions of people and would also prove disastrous for climate change,\" a tweet that accompanies the article said.\n\n\"There are a lot of problems in the world. And global warming is one of them. But it seems to be this obsessive focus just on climate change to the extent that you now actually worry about a nuclear war because it would be bad for global warming is out of whack with reality,\" Lomborg told host Rachel Campos-Duffy.\n\nCORI BUSH WON'T DROP 'DEFUND THE POLICE' SLOGAN EVEN THOUGH DEMS FEAR IT'S POISON AT THE POLLS\n\nThe article argued, if \"you're worried about rapid, catastrophic changes to the planet’s climate, then you must be worried about nuclear war.\"\n\n\"On top of killing tens of millions of people, even a relatively ‘minor’ exchange of nuclear weapons would wreck the planet’s climate in enormous and long-lasting ways,\" the outlet added.\n\nCritics slammed the tweet, calling the article \"silly\" and questioning the \"priorities\" of The Atlantic.\n\nFox News contributor Joe Concha said \"there are no words\" to describe the statement.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAfter a wave of criticism against the piece, Lomborg said humanity should be concerned about avoiding nuclear war in general.\n\n\"Let's get our priorities right. If you want to deal with the problem from Russia, you should be able to have your own energy. That includes getting fracking, maybe going more nuclear. Make sure you get all these energy sources that can actually make you independent instead of just talking about your favorite thing like solar and wind,\" he said, adding global warming must be treated as one of many global problems.",

This is also why Democrats are losing the blue-collar vote is because they are championing these abstract issues in a very foolish manner while making the lives of regular people miserable.\n\nSo it’s not just the vandalism, but it’s also the no drilling, the shutting down of gas stations in California, the banning of gas mowers, the demand to embrace expensive electric cars that require batteries and gas machines with their little batteries.

I don’t believe that China is the biggest threat to America, I believe America is the biggest threat to America, when you look at Geraldo's point, our priorities are so skewed that we are willing to like basically unfree this country, make blue-collar workers and blue-collar voters suffer. This is also why Democrats are losing the blue-collar vote is because they are championing these abstract issues in a very foolish manner while making the lives of regular people miserable. \n\nSo it’s not just the vandalism, but it’s also the no drilling, the shutting down of gas stations in California, the banning of gas mowers, the demand to embrace expensive electric cars that require batteries and gas machines with their little batteries.",

We know that Senator Manchin has received a ton of money, he comes from West Virginia, that happens to be a coal-producing state and in the name of saying he’s protecting his constituents, one, he’s being dishonest speaking to science, like this is an inevitable conclusion that we have to move to clean energy and there are people that invest money in teaching those same workers how to change over and transfer over to that,\" Haines said.\n\nJOY BEHAR GIVES BIDEN A PASS ON ABORTION, BLAMES ‘DINOS' IN CONGRESS: ‘THE GUY IS TRYING’\n\nHaines said climate change was an existential crisis and lawmakers need to get ahead of it and \"rule over money.\"\n\nBehar noted that climate change was a world-wide issue and criticized Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro as well as China, but said that \"we're in trouble because of Manchin\" and the Republican Party.\n\nManchin later denied saying he didn't support Biden's climate and tax provisions in the spending bill and said the reports were overblown.\n\n\"I said, can we just wait until the inflation figures come out [for] July, until we know if the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates,\" Manchin said. \"Then make the decision on what we can do and how much we can do.\"\n\n‘THE VIEW’ HOSTS SHUT DOWN CLAIM THAT ‘RED WAVE IS COMING’: ‘YOU DON’T KNOW THAT'\n\nCo-host Sunny Hostin said West Virginia was the fifth-poorest state in the U.S. and that Manchin \"has been listed as one of the 20 richest senators.\"\n\n\"He has received millions and millions of dollars from the coal and gas industry and therein lies the problem,\" she said.\n\nCo-host Whoopi Goldberg said these decisions and debates affect the people the most. \"Clean your crap up, you know.

            "content": "Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W. Va., opted to support President Biden's green energy agenda in the Senate last week. On the Big Sunday Show, panelists highlighted how the legislation would increase inflation and taxes despite Manchin's assurances to the contrary.\n\nCiting the Joint Committee on Taxation Analysis, co-host Anita Vogel said Manchin was wrong.\n\n\"The bipartisan group says taxes would increase next year for people who earn less than $200,000. The average tax rate for nearly every income bracket would increase, and in about ten years those earning below $400,000 would bear as much as two-thirds of the tax burden thanks to new green energy credits kicking in to help the wealthy,\" she said.\n\n\"They can call it the ‘Inflation Reduction Act’ all they want,\" responded co-host Charles Hurt. \"It is not going to reduce inflation, it is going to increase inflation.\"\n\nCALIFORNIA BATTLES WORST WILDFIRE THIS YEAR AS FLAMES SCORCH MORE THAN 51,000 ACRES\n\n\"There is no such thing as a free meal, money comes from somewhere. Even if you're printing it, money comes from somewhere and working Americans are going to pay the price for this,\" he continued.\n\nVogel cited the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton Budget Model. \"We estimate that the Inflation Reduction Act will produce a very small increase in inflation for the first few years, up to 0.05 percent points in 2024,\" the report said.\n\nRachel Campos-Duffy called the legislation \"such an insult to the American people\" and a \"climate bill that has nothing to do with inflation.\"\n\n\"It's going to raise taxes, it's going to exacerbate inflation,\" she continued.\n\nNATO SAYS IT IS PREPARED TO INTERVENE IN KOSOVO IF ‘STABILITY IS JEOPARDIZED\n\nShe accused Manchin of \"lying\" to his constituents on this issue. Campos-Duffy added that the people of West Virgnia \"don't like Joe Biden, miss Trump, definitely miss Trump gas prices, they miss Trump economy, they miss the Trump foreign policy where every three months we're not facing nuclear catastrophe.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe United States is in a recession after the GDP showed negative growth for the second consecutive quarter. Simultaneously, inflation is at a 40-year-high, with meat, gas, energy bills, and rent prices soaring.",

I want to focus on the here and now. We think the rapid intensification is probably almost done. There could be a little bit more intensification as it still over the warm waters of the eastern Gulf of Mexico but I don't think we’re going to get any more rapid intensification,\" Rhome said.\n\n\"Listen, I’m just trying to get, you said you want to talk about climate change. But what effect does climate change have on this phenomenon that is happening now? Because it seems these storms are intensifying. That’s the question,\" Lemon asked again.\n\nHURRICANE IAN NEARS FLORIDA: STORM SAFETY TIPS AND HOW TO PREPARE\n\n\"I don’t think you can link climate change to any one event. On the whole, on the cumulative, climate change may be making storms worse. But to link it to any one event, I would caution against that,\" Rhome said.\n\nLemon said he grew up in Florida and added that something was making these storms intensify. He asked Rhome about the parts of Florida that weren't going to be taking a \"direct hit\" from the storm.\n\n\"It's really going to be a big event for not just Florida but also Georgia and South Carolina,\" Rhome said.\n\n\"Florida’s coastline has been massively developed. Is this impending storm a warning about that, given the strength of the storms that we are now seeing, as I said before, much bigger in intensity than in my 50-something years on this earth growing up on the Gulf coast?\" Lemon followed up.\n\nDON LEMON ROASTED OVER ROYAL EXPERT'S ANSWER ON BRITAIN PAYING REPARATIONS: ‘HE WAS NOT READY FOR THIS’\n\nRhome said a lot of people were moving to Florida and added that they don't have a lot of experience with Hurricanes. \"I'm really worried about them, hoping that they're rather than try to tackle this one on their own, they're heading the advice of local officials,\" he continued.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nCNN announced recently that Lemon would be ending \"Don Lemon Tonight\" because the anchor is set to move to the network's new morning show.\n\nLemon, in addition to Poppy Harlow and Kaitlan Collins, will host CNN's new, \"re-imagined\" morning program that will replace \"New Day.\"",

            "content": "Most voters in Wisconsin who spoke with Fox News said addressing climate change is more important than curbing inflation ahead of the November midterm elections.\n\n\"Climate change is going to affect our children, our children's children,\" Heather, from Green Bay, said.\n\nBut Matt, from Milwaukee, said he cares more about lowering inflation as he feels the impact of price hikes every day.\n\n\"It comes out of my pocket,\" Matt said. \"I pay for that, and it's easy for me to pick out.\"\n\n2022 MIDTERM NEWS DEMS AND REPUBLICANS FIGHT TO CONTROL SENATE, HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\n\nNearly 80% of Democratic Wisconsin voters said climate change was the most concerning issue, an August Marquette University poll found. Inflation, which nationally hit a 40-year record-high of 9.1% in June, ranked sixth.\n\nClimate change is \"only going to get worse if we don't act on it now,\" London, from Milwaukee, said.\n\nBut 91% of Republican voters polled in the Marquette survey said inflation was their top issue. They rated climate change last.\n\n\"I really don't care about climate change,\" Matt said. \"It's normal for temperature to change.\"\n\nBut Christian, from Milwaukee, said Americans need to think about potentially drastic climate changes ahead in the next few decades.\n\n\"If it's already at 100 degrees it's just going to go up from that,\" Christian said.\n\nU.S. cities reached record-high temperatures over the summer, ranking as the third-hottest season in history. The extreme heat the Pacific Northwest experienced was a once-in-10,000 years event and was driven by climate change, a UCLA researcher found.\n\n\"I would lean towards climate change being a long-term problem,\" Miles, from Wisconsin, said.\n\nDavid, visiting from Texas, told Fox News: \"Climate change is part of a more dire an issue of something that needs to be corrected while the other will eventually correct itself.\" He said the U.S. recovered from heightened inflation in the past.\n\nDemocrats across the country have implemented policies in an effort to slow climate change. Congress, for example, in August passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which included tax subsidies for electric vehicles. Gov. Gavin Newsom recently announced that California would ban the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035.\n\n\"Climate change is something that may be on a trajectory that there is no up and down,\" David said.\n\nUS FARMERS CAN SUPPLY LONG-TERM ENERGY AND CLIMATE SOLUTIONS\n\nBut one man visiting from Florida said inflation is more important as it \"determines the entire economy and affects every family.\"\n\nWhile gas prices decreased slightly after surpassing $5 per gallon in June, grocery store costs, among other expenses, remain high.\n\n\"It's critical that that be addressed,\" one man said on high inflation. \"Climate change is more of a long-term aspiration.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHeather told Fox News that voters shouldn't have to choose if climate change or inflation is more important, as it's critical for politicians to handle multiple dire issues at once.\n\n\"You don’t tackle inflation and ignore climate change,\" Heather said.\n\nIf the government can \"only tackle one issue at a time than they probably shouldn’t be there,\" Heather said. \"We should probably elect somebody else.\"",

            "title": "Florida was wrecked by Ian because DeSantis doesn’t believe in climate change, claims NY Times guest essay",
            "description": "New York Times guest essayist Craig Pittman blasted Gov. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., claiming his climate change skepticism has put Florida at greater risk from hurricanes.",
            "content": "A New York Times guest essay blasted Florida Governor Ron DeSantis’ strategy to protect Florida from massive storms like Hurricane Ian because it ignores how climate change works.\n\nIn the essay, author Craig Pittman argued that DeSantis, R-Fla., insisted on using taxpayer money to shore up Florida’s heavily developed areas in preparation for the storm instead of acknowledging that climate change’s threats to these areas means they should be abandoned, and its inhabitants move to other areas.\n\nIn addition, Pittman claimed DeSantis has done nothing about combating fossil fuel emissions which increase the heat in Florida, intensify storms and promote \"toxic algae blooms.\"\n\nRON DESANTIS ON AFTERMATH OF HURRICANE IAN: WE'RE GETTING PEOPLE BACK ON THEIR FEET | FOX NEWS VIDEO\n\nPittman began his piece by describing the level of destruction in Florida, writing, \"Hurricane Ian didn’t just wreak havoc across Florida’s southwest coast. It also dumped so much rain inland that rivers across the state flooded… The floodwaters blocked highways, inundated cattle ranches and stranded hundreds of people.\"\n\nHe mentioned how the \"shiny white boots\" DeSantis wore to survey the damage on inland parts of his state indicated just how inferior his plan to protect Florida was. Pittman wrote, \"But by donning those wading boots, usually worn by fishermen on the coasts, Governor DeSantis exposed a truth he has avoided for the last four years: Climate change isn’t just happening along Florida’s edge.\"\n\nThe author then slammed the governor’s refusal to acknowledge climate change, declaring, \"When he was running to replace Gov. Rick Scott, a climate change denier, Mr. DeSantis sneered that he was ‘not in the pews of the church of the global warming leftists.’\"\n\nAnd to the disappointment of climate change advocates, DeSantis used \"taxpayer money to protect the rampant development of low-lying areas such as Lee County — development that some of Governor DeSantis’s staunchest campaign contributors helped lead.\"\n\nPittman wrote, \"Hurricane Ian has revealed in brutal detail the inadequacy of his approach,\" adding, \"The sea walls, sewage pump stations, wastewater treatment plants and ‘living shorelines’ that taxpayers funded did little to help inland towns like Arcadia. Hundreds of Central Florida homes remain flooded two weeks on, as rivers flush out the heavy rain.\"\n\nHe pointed out climate change’s effect on this flooding: \"One study found that climate change may have added 10 percent to Ian’s rainfall.\"\n\nThe piece hammered the DeSantis strategy, stating, \"Protecting Florida from the effects of future storms like Ian calls for more than just resilience. It calls for carefully retreating from the rising water and rebuilding where it’s safe. But retreat has never been in Governor DeSantis’s plan.\"\n\nIt added, \"There has been little to no attempt by his administration to stop further development in vulnerable coastal areas.\" The piece also claimed that DeSantis’ plan doesn’t actually solve the major issue. \"Expensive resilience projects like the ones the governor has supported can only ever be a temporary fix. As the sea level rises, they will have to be replaced, made higher, built larger… They don’t address the cause of climate change, only the symptoms, and only for a little while.\"\n\nPittman argued that the governor could get it right if he actually considers climate change’s effects. \"If Governor DeSantis ever gets serious about a changing climate, the place to start is with the emissions that are also driving Florida’s other dangerous impacts.\"\n\nHe listed those impacts as \"the intensifying heat waves that put outdoor workers at risk of dehydration and death, the warmer ocean waters causing rapid intensification of storms like Ian and the toxic algae blooms, which are also exacerbated by pollution.\"\n\nHowever, he claimed, \"The governor has gone in the other direction. Rather than encouraging homes and businesses to switch to renewable energy or requiring any retreat from the growing risks of climate-fueled devastation, he has taken steps to protect the oil and gas industry spewing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.\"\n\nPittman concluded, saying, \"If resilience, Florida style, goes national, we all may need some of those white boots.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
